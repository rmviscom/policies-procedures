# A. Introduction



Since our beginning as a General Contractor, we have developed and grown into a well-managed organization that has never lost sight of the fact that serving the needs of our customers is our reason for being. Our proven ability to serve the needs of our customers has helped us grow into a corporation that is involved on a day-to-day basis with the management of multi-million-dollar construction projects.

Our experienced professionals are educated and trained to assist our customers in achieving their goals. Our people excel in meeting our responsibilities to the owner in the areas of planning, organizing, and managing projects. We recognize that flexibility and responsiveness to our customers' needs are often the difference between an acceptable job and an excellent one. Our commitment to excellence is not a goal; it is our way of life. This commitment must be evident in everything we do.
