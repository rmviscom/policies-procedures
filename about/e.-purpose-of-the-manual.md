# E. Purpose of the Manual

The purpose of this Policies and Procedures Manual is to provide a reference for the policies and procedures, which have been established as a management guide. It has been divided into two major divisions: Operations and Administration, to emphasize field operations procedures and corporate office administration policies and how they relate to each other and combine to form the total management policy of the company.

The Operations portion of the manual has been patterned to follow the procedures used in the course of a construction project from estimate to close-out.

The Administration section of the manual presents company policies in a more detailed manner and includes policies and procedures for the corporate office management. The information provided in each of these two divisions is interrelated and together forms the total company policies and procedures manual.
