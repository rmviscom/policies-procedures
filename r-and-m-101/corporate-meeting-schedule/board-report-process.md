# Board Report Process

## Overview

The board report is produced **four times per year** or once a quarter.

Our team is responsible for the following items for the board report:

* **In-progress project photos:** Robin Savage selects specific projects for the project update section. [Amanda Bradley Witteck](mailto:abradley@robinsmorton.com) coordinates the project updates section of the Board Report. Before each board meeting, she will request aerial photos of the selected projects from the marketing team.&#x20;
  * Marketing team members are expected to communicate with their designated project teams to gather the most recent aerial photos. These photos are included as a part of each project update and uploaded to OpenAsset.
* **Written project update:** The project operations manager or project executive provides a written summary of the project’s status.&#x20;
  * Our communications team reviews the write-up to ensure consistent brand language use. Each marketing team member may also be asked to review the project updates as an additional secondary set of eyes, or to help confirm project schedule dates or other key components.

Once all photos have been gathered and all written content is complete, Amanda Bradley Witteck submits this portion of the report to [Lisa Cowan](mailto:lcowan@robinsmorton.com).

* **Quarterly Sales Update:** Farrah Mote and Katy Klaproth assemble a summary of the quarterly sales data to be included in the board report package. No additional information is needed from any other Marketing and Communications team members for this report.
