# Brand Standards

At Robins & Morton, our brand is more than the logo on our hard hats – our brand is also evident in the words that we use to express who we are. This is a critical piece to strengthening our position in the marketplace and ensuring that we remain in good standing in the many communities where we live and work. Although we look to our marketing and communications teams to lead our definitions on our culture, our brand, and our voice, we are all representatives of who Robins & Morton is at its core.&#x20;

Below are our Robins & Morton brand standards customized for Marketing, Departments and Jobsites.&#x20;
