# Community Outreach

We can give back to our community in several ways. Fundraising, volunteering, and donating are three categories that offices/jobsites can give back to the areas we work and live in.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have an event or donation request, please complete the [Giving With Purpose form on HUB](https://hub.robinsmorton.com/content/page/6633c360f2b9e933c1861374) and the Giving With Purpose committee will review your request.
{% endhint %}

**Seeking financial support for a charity or cause**

## Volunteering&#x20;

**How do you decide on what to do for your community outreach?** Below are some items to think about when making your decision on outreach:

1. Does our client have a charity or support a specific charity?
2. Are we all passionate about a specific charity?
3. Is there a specific time of year you want to focus your efforts on? If so, what are some charitable events in your area during that time?
