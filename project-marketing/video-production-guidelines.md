# Video Production Guidelines

## Who handles video production?

* **For Marketing & Sales Support Videos:**\
  If a video is needed for marketing or sales support purposes, the designated/regional marketing team member will be responsible for sourcing the video production resource and coordinating all video production efforts.
* **For Communications Projects:**\
  If the video is for an internal or external communications project, the communications team will be responsible for sourcing the video production resource and coordinating all video production efforts.

## Preferred Vendors

We have two preferred video production companies that we work with regularly. These vendors know our style, deliver great quality, and help keep things consistent. Below are our two video resources:

* **Pitts Media**\
  Birmingham, AL\
  205-792-1280
  * Dylan Lard – [dylan@pittsmedia.com](mailto:dylan@pittsmedia.com)
  * Cody Eldridge – [cody@pittsmedia.com](mailto:cody@pittsmedia.com)
* **Spoken Motion**\
  Orlando, FL\
  407-694-1579
  * Travis Hull – [travis@spokenmotionstudio.com](mailto:travis@spokenmotionstudio.com)

If the project location or specific needs make it tough to use these vendors, we can explore additional options as needed. Please contact [Katy Klaproth](mailto:kklaproth@robinsmorton.com) to coordinate additional resources.

## In-House Video Resources

Before going external, check if our in-house team members can help! Our IT, VDC, and JET teams have great drone and timelapse capabilities that might be just what you need, and they can often be a quicker and more cost-effective option.

## How to Get Started

1. Figure out whether the video falls under marketing/sales or communications.
2. Determine if the video needs can be met using our in-house resources or if we need to engage our external partners.
3. If the video can be done by in-house team members, please coordinate with the appropriate departmental contacts. If we need to engage our external partners, please contact the appropriate vendor to get a quote. If needed, contact [Katy Klaproth](mailto:kklaproth@robinsmorton.com) for additional options due to location or project-specific challenges.
4. Coordinate production and make sure everything aligns with our messaging and branding.

Following this process helps keep things streamlined, ensures great quality, and makes the most of our available resources.
