# Milestone Events

Marketing and Communications team members provide support for project and industry related events. Project events may include groundbreaking ceremony, topping out celebrations, and ribbon cuttings. Industry events may include speaking opportunities, professional conferences, career fairs, and exhibitions.&#x20;

Type and level of support varies. You should coordinate all support needs with your division operations manager or project manager in charge of the project, if applicable. Depending on the size of the project and/or event, support may include:&#x20;

* Coordinating with client to create a day-of agenda&#x20;
* Ordering materials such as promotional items, sand and shovels for groundbreaking, crane signage for topping out, printed marketing collateral, etc.

### Topping Out

A ceremony celebrating the building reaching its full height, often commemorated by the project team erecting a steel beam signed by all stakeholders. The steel beam is decorated with an evergreen tree and an American flag.&#x20;

The exact specifications for each of these events is typically dictated by the client, with Robins & Morton project and Marketing team managing various aspects. Typically, a promotional item(s) is given away to attendees including the construction team. This is most commonly a t-shirt.&#x20;

Topping out shirts can take a while to go through the design and approval process, so it’s recommended that Marketing start on this as soon as possible.
