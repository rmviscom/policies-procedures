[Request a topping out t-shirt here](https://form.jotform.com/231295965550059). The graphics team will create a proof, get approval from you and your team, then order the shirts through Concepts to be delivered to the project by the requested date.

T-shirts are a common giveaway. They typically include:

* a rendering of the project
* the client name/logo
* names or logos of the design team and/or major trades

**Avoid putting specific dates on event tees.** It is acceptable to include the month/year or season/year (November 2025, Fall 2025)
