# Project Photography

## Project Photography

#### In-progress photography&#x20;

In-progress photography is key to marketing our company and selling our services. These images are used to tell our projects’ and people’s stories in proposals, presentations, award entries and more.&#x20;

* To schedule professional in-progress photography, contact [Skylar Dickson](mailto:sdickson@robinsmorton.com).&#x20;
* For in-progress timelapse photography, contact [Nic East](mailto:neast@robinsmorton.com).&#x20;

#### Final photography&#x20;

Final project photography is a valuable asset used in marketing and sales pursuits. Images of the completed project are typically captured after furniture is in, artwork is up and landscaping complete and before the facility is occupied. Contact [Skylar Dickson](mailto:sdickson@robinsmorton.com) to schedule your project photography.&#x20;

#### Safety Checklist

If you take any project photos while visiting a project site, please be sure to follow our pre-photo or video safety checklist. When uploading any photos to OpenAsset, please upload them to the Safety Review folder so Jeff Palombo and Corey Kennedy can review photos for approval of use.
