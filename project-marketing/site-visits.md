# Site Visits

Visiting a jobsite allows our team to see firsthand the complexities of the project, including site conditions, safety concerns, and logistical issues. This firsthand experience fosters better communication, enhances decision-making, and builds empathy, ultimately leading to more effective collaboration and a stronger, more cohesive company culture

BEST PRACTICES&#x20;

* Dress for Success:&#x20;
  * Adequate work shoes (leather boots, minimum 6” height, non-slip soles)&#x20;
  * Eye protection (safety glasses)&#x20;
  * Hi-Visibility vest&#x20;
  * Cotton shirt with sleeves (no tank tops)&#x20;
  * Long pants&#x20;
  * Hard hat
* Prepare for the weather and dress appropriately to prevent a heat/cold related illness. Be sure you are fit for duty before visiting a project site.&#x20;
* Always have a guide to lead you around the site. Stay close to your guide as you move around the site.&#x20;
* Ask your guide if there are any emergency action procedures you need to be made aware of. If an emergency occurs, follow the direction of your guide. Always know where the closest exit is.&#x20;
* Be aware of your surroundings and footings on the active site. Watch where you step and there may be changes in elevation, uneven terrain and other similar hazards. Use the handrails where provided.&#x20;
* If you climb a ladder, use the 3-point contact method at all times (2 hands, 1 foot or 1 hand and 2 feet in contact with the ladder at all times.) Be sure your boots are clean before going up or down the ladder.&#x20;
* If you hear a whistle or horn, look up as a load may be flying overhead – do not stand under the load. Do not stand near a load being hoisted/lowered by a crane or similar as loads tend to shift and could create a hazard for you.&#x20;
* Pay attention to barricades – Do not cross red Danger Tape. Ask your guide for direction when yellow Caution tape is observed.&#x20;
* Avoid distractions such as using your cell phone or having a conversation in a busy corridor or equipment travel path.&#x20;
* Watch where you put your hands – be cautious of pinch points and sharp objects. If you need to touch something, ask your guide for the appropriate gloves.&#x20;
* Try not to brush up against surfaces as they may have rough edges or be wet with paint or other type of substance.&#x20;
* Never walk behind equipment or machinery. Follow the instructions of your guide on how to approach equipment and/or move around the site.&#x20;
* Stay clear of power tools and tasks that create flying debris that could pose a hazard to you.&#x20;
* Guardrails are in place for your protection. Do not lean against, climb on/over/through guardrails of any kind.&#x20;
* If you see a welding task in progress, do not watch the arc (bright light/flash) – look away. The arc will damage your eyes even with safety glasses on.&#x20;
* Photos may or may not be permitted – please ask your guide for further information. If a photo is permitted, be cautious not to distract/startle those whom you are photographing.&#x20;
* Photos intended to be shared on social/ media platforms must be approved by R\&M Director of Safety Development, Corey Kennedy and Jeff Palombo, VP of Safety Operations.&#x20;
* Observe daily stand up, task planning and safety meetings when able.&#x20;
* Say hello to a craft professional and thank them for their hard work.
