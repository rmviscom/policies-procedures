# Character Styles

#### Character styles are _exceptions_.

Character styles apply only to selected characters, NOT to the entire paragraph. If you want to change some of the words in a sentence to bold, you would apply the bold character style to those words.&#x20;

Why? Because **character styles remain in place even if the paragraph style changes.**&#x20;

If you have manually changed a word to bold text _without_ applying the character style Bold, when you change the paragraph style (from \_Body to Intro Text, for example) the bold text will disappear. If you changed a word to bold by applying the correct paragraph style, the bold text will remain in place.

<summary>NoBreak</summary>

When applied to a string of text, this style ensures that all of the text is on one line - the line will not "break" inside that text.

_Example:_ Apply NoBreak to the text "Robins & Morton" so that the company name always falls on the same line.

<summary>Colors</summary>

Any character style that is labeled a color (i.e. Red, Navy, Black, White) changes the color of the text it is applied to. It does not change the size or weight of the text.

_Exception:_ The White character style does change the weight of the text to Regular. This is because typically white text is appearing over a dark background, and the Light font weight is often hard to read when reversed.

<summary>Bold</summary>

Changes the weight of the selected text to Bold.
