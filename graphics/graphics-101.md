### Install fonts

Brand fonts are located in the #Design Resources/03 Fonts folder [here](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/folder/d06d9f7b-9be2-4992-b0b4-9531d34aa2dd).&#x20;

These three fonts are the most important to install right away:

* [01 NB International Pro](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/folder/ca2f3acd-f8df-49a5-b47b-6452cfdfa7f1) _Primary brand font_
