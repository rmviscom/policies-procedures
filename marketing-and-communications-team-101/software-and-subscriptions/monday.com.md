# monday.com

Our primary uses of the platform are to track primary functions of the team such as pursuit management, weekly task tracking and communication project management. Each function of the Marketing team has a unique project management board within our team workspace. In each of these boards, we have incorporated relevant tracking and reporting elements for board’s project(s) (i.e. what, when, who and time tracking).&#x20;

We then pull data from these boards to track items such as hit rate, resource capacity, and productivity benchmarking.&#x20;

Our team name for the purposes of logging in is _robinsmorton-global_
