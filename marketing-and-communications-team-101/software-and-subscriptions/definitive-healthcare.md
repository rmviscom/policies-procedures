# Definitive Healthcare

Robins & Morton maintains a subscription to this service to aid our sales teams in gathering valuable information for project and client pursuits. The subscription includes a limited number of seats, which are given to all Marketing and Communications team members as well as Ben Leaver, CFO. This allows our marketing and communications team to research and gather information as a part of our project pursuit process.

In addition to the subscription service, Robins & Morton also generates an annual Power BI report that provides a comparison of healthcare systems by state against the healthcare work Robins & Morton has completed in the past five years. This Power BI report is shared with our sales team members and is available here:
