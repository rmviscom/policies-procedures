# PlusDelta

PlusDelta is a Lean tool designed to facilitate continuous improvement discussions at the closing of a meeting, project, or event. This process is often facilitated on pen/paper.&#x20;

Robins & Morton developed PlusDelta.app to improve the Plus Delta process. PlusDelta.app is free to the public and provides a digital platform specifically customized to host Plus Delta sessions across settings: in person; digital; and hybrid.&#x20;
