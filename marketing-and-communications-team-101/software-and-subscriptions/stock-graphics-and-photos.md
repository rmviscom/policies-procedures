# Stock Graphics and Photos

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never use stock photos or AI-generated images** in externally-facing deliverables like proposals or sales presentations. Use approved images from OpenAsset.
{% endhint %}

### Best practices for photos

* Use Robins & Morton photos from OpenAsset whenever possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;To find the best people pics, search "true builder" on OA.
{% endhint %}

* If you do use a stock photo, avoid representations of people. If you must use a stock photo of people, choose diverse representations to reflect the wide variety of people who will view the photo.&#x20;

### Best practices for vector graphics and illustrations

* You can modify vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator.&#x20;
* Whenever possible, update colors in your downloaded graphics to match our branding.
