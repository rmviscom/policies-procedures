# Microsoft Teams

## Video Conferences

Teams is the preferred video conference platform for internal and external Robins & Morton communications. All salaried team members have access to a Microsoft Teams account, and most conference rooms in our corporate and regional offices are equipped to host Teams meetings. Should you need to schedule video conference or hybrid meeting internal to Robins & Morton, use Teams.&#x20;

**If you are scheduling a video conference or hybrid meeting with team members outside of Robins & Morton, you have the option to use Teams or Zoom.** However, if participating members are comfortable with and have access to Teams, it is easiest to host all meetings through Teams.&#x20;

Should you need the Robins & Morton Zoom account, please contact Division Marketing Director [Farrah Mote](mailto:fmote@robinsmorton.com).
