## When to use Microsoft Forms vs. Jotform

| Microsoft Forms                                                                              | Jotform                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can automatically capture the name and email of users because they are logged into Microsoft | Users must manually enter their name and email                             |
| Limited types of fields and control over user experience                                     | Extensive library of field types and granular control over user experience |
| No notable integrations with other platforms like monday.com                                 | Many integrations and automations available                                |

When creating a form, decide which platform to use based on the complexity of your needs. For fast, simple forms, use Microsoft. For more complex forms or when you need more control over the look and feel of your form, Jotform is the better solution.
