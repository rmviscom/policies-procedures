# Building Forward® Assessments

Each quarter the Marketing and Communications department sets aside time (typically at a Tuesday meeting) to complete a Building Forward® assessment. This group conversation allows us to track the tools we use to achieve a great team culture and address issues that may otherwise go overlooked.&#x20;

Building Forward® assessment data is reported to Jennifer Lacy.
