# Industry Memberships

## SMPS

Society for Marketing Professional Services (SMPS) is a national organization of marketing and business development professionals that work together to move the Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry forward. The mission of the organization is “to advocate for, educate and connect leaders in the building industry.”&#x20;

The organization structure consists of local chapters across the United States and Canada. **Robins & Morton encourages its Marketing and Communications team members to get involved in their local chapter.**&#x20;

Local chapters host a variety of events. Some events may be educational opportunities to learn or improve a skill, other events may be industry focused and allow networking opportunities.&#x20;

Each chapter is run by volunteers. There are opportunities to join committees and get involved in your local chapter.&#x20;

Annually, SMPS holds a national conference along with regional conferences. An SMPS conference is typically 2-3 days long. **Robins & Morton encourages its Marketing and Communications team members to attend a conference.** Like all conferences, this needs to be a planned and budgeted. Please work with your direct report to discuss the opportunity to attend a conference.&#x20;

If you are not yet a member of SMPS, please discuss membership with [Katy Klaproth](mailto:kklaproth@robinsmorton.com).&#x20;
