# Brochures

## Art

Design files for our corporate collateral can be found in Egnyte:

```
/Shared/Marketing Department/Graphic Design/Corporate Collateral
```

{% embed url="https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/fl/JeTsn7d4HR" %}

There, you can find various brochures (healthcare, hospitality, commercial) as well as corporate documents like Fast Facts, Differentiators, the Environmental, Social, and Economic report (ESE), and the Report on Company Health, Strategy, and Initiatives (aka the Strategic Planning Guide or SPG).

Some corporate collateral can be customized for your region or division as needed.



## Production

We use different vendors for printing items depending on time and cost constraints. Please reach out to [Ginny Fowler](mailto:ginny.fowler@robinsmorton.com) for recommendations.&#x20;
