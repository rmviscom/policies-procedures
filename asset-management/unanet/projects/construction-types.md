## Renovation

Renovation involves the remodeling or refurbishment of an existing facility to improve its functionality, aesthetics, or both. It typically includes upgrades, repairs, and modernization without completely rebuilding the structure.

***

## Replacement

Replacement refers to the complete removal of an existing structure or system and the installation of a new one in its place. This can include replacing outdated equipment, components, infrastructure, or entire buildings.

***

## Addition / Expansion

Addition or expansion involves increasing the size or capacity of an existing facility. This can include adding square footage to accommodate growth or changing needs.

***

## Vertical Expansion

Vertical expansion specifically focuses on increasing a structure's height, often by adding additional floors or levels.

***

## Buildout

Buildout refers to the process of completing the interior of a shell space according to a specific design or purpose. This can involve building out rooms, constructing walls, installing equipment or components, and setting up utilities.

***

## Demolition

Demolition is the controlled dismantling or destruction of a structure to make way for new construction or to remove unsafe or obsolete buildings. It involves the careful removal of materials and debris.&#x20;

***

## Sitework

Sitework encompasses all the activities involved in preparing a construction site for building, including grading, excavation, utility installation, and other preliminary tasks.

***

## Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse involves repurposing an existing building or structure for a different function than its original purpose. This sustainable approach helps preserve historical structures while meeting modern needs.

***

## Freestanding

Freestanding structures are new independent structures that are not part of multi-building campuses or physically connected to other buildings. They stand alone and are not reliant on neighboring structures for support.

***

## Brownfield

Brownfield refers to a previously developed or industrial site that may be contaminated but is being considered for redevelopment. The goal is to revitalize the land for a new purpose.

***

## Greenfield / New

Greenfield / “New” in construction indicates a completely fresh project or structure, built from the ground up, with no existing components or structures on the designated site.

***

## Temporary/Modular Construction

Temporary or modular construction involves the use of prefabricated components or structures that can be quickly assembled and disassembled. This approach is often employed for short-term or flexible space needs.

***

## Restoration

Restoration involves returning a structure to its original or historically accurate condition. This process focuses on preserving the architectural and historical elements of the building.
