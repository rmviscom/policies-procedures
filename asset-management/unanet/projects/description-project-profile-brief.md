## Special Characters and Style

* **Be sure commas are added where appropriate.** Occasionally they are omitted from reports and replaced with an extra space. This is a Unanet issue. Be sure they are correct in the project’s profile descriptions.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_
  *   Remodel of Historic Central Station: Hilton Hotel, Dining, Retail, and Parking Deck


*   **Follow the** [**Robins & Morton In-House Style Guide**](https://hub.robinsmorton.com/content/news/article/65c7324bd5903319b3390d74)**.** Entries are listed alphabetically and linked in the index for ease of use.&#x20;

    _Examples:_

    * **Ampersand (&):** Do not use ampersands except in the company name. Spell out “and.”\
      Note: The company name should not be included in Standard Descriptions.
    * **Buildout:** Use _buildout_ rather than _upfit_ or _fit up_.
    * **Commas:** Use commas to separate all elements in a simple series. Our in-house style dictates the use of the Oxford comma.
    * **Owner:** Our preferred term is _client_ (lowercase). Use _owner_ (lowercase) only internally and when the term _client_ may be unclear.
    * **Subcontractors:** Avoid this term. Use _trade contractors_ instead. Never use the term subs. (See _trade contractors / trade partners_ entry.)
