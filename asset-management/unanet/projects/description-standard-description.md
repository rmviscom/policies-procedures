# Description: Standard Description

<div align="center" data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/StandardDescription.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Example Standard Description</p></figcaption></figure></div>

## **Capitalization**

**Use title-case capitalization.** An exception to our In-House Style Guide rule on capitalization, we do use title case in Standard Descriptions. As in all title-case situations, conjunctions like “and” and prepositions like “with” should be lowercase to keep it clear and readable.

## Numbers

**If you&#x20;**_**must**_**&#x20;use bed numbers or number of stories, do so only because there is no better information available.** Use numeral followed by hyphen and capitalize.

_Both number of stories AND number of rooms should NOT be used in the same description. Delete one of them._
