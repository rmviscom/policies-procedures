### HARD BID OPPORTUNITIES (TAGGING)

A hard bid opportunity is a sales opportunity that is primarily price driven and requires little to no marketing engagement. The market engagement may include single or limited deliverables such as an organizational chart and/or resumes. If the opportunity’s selection criteria are primarily driven by qualifications, or if qualifications and price are weighted equally and the criteria require additional marketing engagement to provide responses to RFQ or RFP-style questions, then the opportunity will shift to a negotiated proposal and not a hard bid opportunity.

## Sales Meeting Rules of the Road

* Preparation is essential – know the answers to the 20% questions
* Avoid “optimism clouded” judgment – stick to the criteria for forecasting decisions
* Avoid utilization of 20% projects as a place holder or “claim” to a project
* Utilize Unanet, strategic pursuit tools, and sales strategy meetings to 20%T prospects
