## Defining a Sale

#### SALE

A “sale” is booked when the order to proceed has been received either verbally or in writing. (This is usually just a matter of weeks before construction actually begins).&#x20;

&#x20;

## Opportunity Get Percentages &#x20;

### 0% MARKET OPPORTUNITY

Defined as a specific identified project that will not start until sometime beyond the current year. Not enough information is known to qualify it as a 20, 80 or 100% Forecasted Sale.&#x20;

### 20% HOPEFULLY (JUDGMENT CALL)

1. Have an inside relationship (may be client, architect, engineer or program manager)
2. Know who the likely decision makers are and their process
3. Know the delivery method (negotiated/fee bid/CM@Risk/IPD/Lump Sum/Cost Plus/Etc.)
4. Know the basic strategy for the sale (board involvement/JV Partner/LEAN/local participation, etc.)&#x20;
5. Know size, general scope of project, and timing for the start date
6. Know CON Status/Permitting Status
7. Source/Status of funding is known and it is feasible
8. Competition is generally known
9. Decision date is generally known

### 20%T  TOP PROSPECTS (03-Top Prospect)

1. Meets all the criteria of a 20% opportunity
2. The sales leader is utilizing strategic pursuit planning tools for positioning
3. Project is strategically important due to one or both of the below reasons:
4. The opportunity is with a new client (not necessarily a large project, but key to getting us in the door)
5. It is a large project with an existing client
6. The project is not awarded, has a higher potential for success, and needs critical focus to accomplish division sales goals over the coming sales period.

### 20%A  VERBAL AWARDS (07-Won)

1. Project is awarded
2. Project may have multiple decisions/factors to work through before start date
3. Source/Status of funding is known and it is feasible

### 80% PRETTY SURE (07-Won)

1. Project is awarded
2. Except for one solvable problem, it’s a go
3. Permitting is pending

### 100% SURE (07-Won)

1. CON, permitting, funding, awarded job, no competition, design proceeding – all obstacles and impediments are solved      &#x20;
2. Assured in manager’s judgment the project will go
3. A contract is completed or under negotiation

### HARD BID OPPORTUNITIES (TAGGING)

A hard bid opportunity is a sales opportunity that is primarily price driven and requires little to no marketing engagement. The market engagement may include single or limited deliverables such as an organizational chart and/or resumes. If the opportunity’s selection criteria are primarily driven by qualifications, or if qualifications and price are weighted equally and the criteria require additional marketing engagement to provide responses to RFQ or RFP-style questions, then the opportunity will shift to a negotiated proposal and not a hard bid opportunity.

## Sales Meeting Rules of the Road

* Preparation is essential – know the answers to the 20% questions
* Avoid “optimism clouded” judgment – stick to the criteria for forecasting decisions
* Avoid utilization of 20% projects as a place holder or “claim” to a project
* Utilize Unanet, strategic pursuit tools, and sales strategy meetings to 20%T prospects
