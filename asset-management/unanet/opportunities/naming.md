# Naming

## Opportunity Name Standards

#### **Opportunity Name** = _Facility name with description identifier_

_Example:_ Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Vertical Expansion

* When entering the Project Name or the Other Project Name, be sure to use the **specific facility name**, not the owner name.
  * _For example:_ Duke Health is the owner. The facility name would be Duke University Medical Center or Duke Raleigh Hospital.&#x20;
* **Use Google and/or Definitive Healthcare to get the formal facility name.**
