# Marketing Department folder best practices

No folder structure or file organization system is going to be perfect. But to be effective, you have to use it all the time, every time. Don’t save everything to your desktop or My Documents and tell yourself “I’ll move it later.” Otherwise, the only thing you’ll end up with is a half-finished organizational system.

#### 1. Store all shared files in Egnyte/Share/Marketing Department.

* Don’t store in K/Sales.
* Don’t store in Box.com.
* Don’t store in Teams.
* Don’t store on personal hard drives.

#### 2. All shared files must be saved in the following main file folders:

* Communications
* Department
* Events
* Graphic Design
* Opportunities
* Projects
* Sales

#### 3. Store all personal files in Egnyte/Private. Folders shouldn’t be named after a person. Conversely, there should be no shared files in Egnyte/Private.

#### 4. Name folders and files consistently by:

* Keeping names brief and abbreviating when possible (see #12)
* Capitalizing the first letter of each word (NO ALL CAPS and no all lowercase)
* Using subfolders wisely
* Including opportunity numbers for opportunities and project numbers for projects
* Matching owner, client, project and opportunity names consistent with Unanet (formerly known as Cosential)
* Avoiding special characters

#### 5. Photography, conceptual graphics and similar assets should be stored in _Open Asset only_ and not in Egnyte.

#### 6. Group folders by date when necessary (Events/ASHE/2019, Awards/ABC/2019)

#### 7. Rather than duplicating files, create folder shortcuts.

#### 8. Don’t create floating folders.

#### 9. Think before you create and name folders and files. Use Teams/Asset Management to discuss folder and file storage ideas, changes and questions.

#### 10. Support Process - Users can submit a ticket to R\&M IT, after which they will escalate to Network Coverage and/or Egnyte support depending on the case.

#### 11. Look in the following folders for auto recovered files:

* Mac OS X: Users/\[User Name]/Library/Cache/Adobe InDesign/Version\[#.0]/InDesign Recovery
* Windows/PC: C:\Users\\\[User Name]\AppData\Local\Adobe\InDesign\Version \[#].0\en\_US\Caches\InDesign Recovery

#### 12. Path and Character Limits

* Be aware when naming files and folders to not exceed the path/character limits below.
* Cloud: Limit is 245 bytes per path component (e.g. a file or folder name) and 5000 bytes for the entire path (including the filename). Microsoft Office imposes a 215 character limit on Office files.
* Desktop Sync for Windows: Desktop Sync for Windows is subject to the same path length limitations as Microsoft Windows.
* Egnyte Connect Desktop App (Egnyte Drive) for Mac/Windows: When opening files from the Desktop App, Microsoft Excel is still subject to the maximum folder path limit of 218 characters despite the drive being able to handle longer paths.
* Be aware when naming files and folders to not use the special characters below.
*   To maintain compatibility with Windows’ file naming conventions, we do not support file and folder names which include the following characters or have any of the specified naming patterns:

    \ / “ : <> | \* ?
* end with period(s)
* begin or end with spaces
* have control characters
* have Unicode characters with 4 or more bytes
