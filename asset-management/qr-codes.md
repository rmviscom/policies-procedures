# QR Codes

The site we use to generate dynamic QR codes (that can be changed after the code is created) is:

{% embed url="https://app.the-qrcode-generator.com" %}

## How to log in

1. Navigate to [https://app.the-qrcode-generator.com](https://app.the-qrcode-generator.com)
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. In the pop up window, sign in using this Google account:
   1. **Email:** rmqrcodes@gmail.com
   2. **Password:** Robins1947!

## Best Practices

### Re-using existing codes

Using the filter field, search for keywords or part of the url that you'd like to create a QR code for. If one exists, you can download the existing QR code image for use.

### Naming and folders

When you create a new code you can give it a name. This is only used for organization in the back end of the app. If you are creating a batch of codes for use in one pursuit or presentation, for example, you can add them to a folder.

### Saving files

Remember to save your QR code into your pursuit/presentation folder in Egnyte. PNG files are fine for most uses. SVG is a vector format that is preferable for scaling to large sizes.

### Minimum size

Minimum size for printed QR codes is one inch wide.

### Customization

The QR Code Generator app allows you to customize the look of your code. You can change the colors of the dots in your code, but **the dots must be darker than the background color.** A white QR code on a black background will not work.

You can also add a logo to the middle of your QR code. **Use this sparingly** - only add an icon when it helps the user know what the QR code is for.&#x20;

## Analytics

Once your QR code has been published, you can visit the site to view analytics. **Remember to select the time period you want analytics for - the default is 14 days.** You can also export analytics to a spreadsheet.

These include:

* Number of scans
* Unique users
* Scans by city
* Scans by devices used
* Scans by country
* Scans by location
