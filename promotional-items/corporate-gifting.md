# Corporate Gifting

Robins & Morton will provide corporate gifts to our clients and partners for events like anniversaries, corporate events, or general appreciation. To create gifting projects, a committee of Marketing team members is created and lead by Amanda Bradley Witteck to determine specifications (specs) for the gift.&#x20;

Once specs have been outlined and goals and budget have been determined, the project will be sent for proposals with approved vendors, including Concepts & Associates. A vendor will be selected on price, quality, and confidence in ability.&#x20;

For examples and more information on past corporate gifting to our clients and partners, please reach out to [Amanda Bradley Witteck](mailto:abradley@robinsmorton.com).
