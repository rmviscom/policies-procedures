# Estimate Number

1.  The Preconstruction Manager/Estimator will request an estimate
    number (with the agreement of the OM responsible for the project)
    via Unanet by following [OP-010.1 Estimate Number Request
    Procedure](OP-010.1%20Estimate%20Number%20Request%20Procedure.pdf).

2.  Costs incurred during the preconstruction phase of the project will
    be charged to the estimate number. The following phase codes are
    established to differentiate costs charged to an estimate number:

    a.  100 Phase Code

        i.  RFP/RFQ, Conceptual, and Schematic Phase Preconstruction
            Services

        ii. RFP/RFQ, Conceptual, and Schematic Phase Scheduling

    b.  200 Phase Code

        i.  Design Development Phase Preconstruction Services

        ii. DD Phase Scheduling

    c.  300 Phase Code

        i.  Construction Document Phase Preconstruction Services

        ii. Early Release Packages

        iii. Early Equipment Purchasing

        iv. CD Phase Scheduling

    d.  400 Phase Code

        i.  This phase code is intended for job cost related items
            during the Preconstruction Phase and should be transferred
            to job cost after establishing a project job number.
            Transferring or recoding of this cost will be the
            responsibility of the Project Manager. Some examples of 400
            Phase Code costs are:

            1.  Operations Personnel assisting with Preconstruction
                Services or during project mobilization

            2.  Building Permit fee

            3.  Overall Project Schedule development

            4.  VDC Personnel assisting with BIM coordination
