## Sharing your project story

Telling your project’s story is not only a crucial component to sharing knowledge within our company, but also bettering the construction industry as a whole. Robins & Morton leads our peers in many aspects of construction, and our clients are seeking true pioneers to improve the building experience. To establish ourselves as leaders, we have to share our knowledge, and there are a variety of ways to do so. Whether it’s announcing your project’s groundbreaking, or sharing a creative solution that helped your project save time and money, stories can result in publication on a variety of mediums. Sometimes, one story can even be used in a variety of capacities. A few of the ways you story can be used are outlined below.&#x20;
