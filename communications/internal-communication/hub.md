## Information Structure

### Pages&#x20;

[Pages](https://support.staffbase.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004505491-Pages-Plugin) are intended for **static, long-lifespan content.** The content remains active in the user’s radar for a long time. Page content has high relevance and is of a permanent nature, and has limited chances of going out of date.&#x20;

* Each RM department has a homepage and subpages that can be bookmarked or linked to for future use. Ex: [Marketing and Communications Home](https://app.gitbook.com/u/VqX9g9NW4XYb9zu0rPyEiduFyhV2)
* Pages are not time-stamped and do not allow users to comment, like, or share directly from the page.

### Posts&#x20;

[Posts](https://support.staffbase.com/hc/en-us/sections/201587855-News-Plugin) are short- or medium-lifespan pieces of content that are organized into [Channels](https://support.staffbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/206435069-Creating-a-Channel). We have designated two types of Channels for our use at Robins & Morton:

#### Knowledge Channels

Any channel in the Studio labeled "Knowledge" is intended for **static, medium-lifespan content**. The HUB Knowledge Base is a centralized repository of information that includes articles, how-to guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting steps, often supplemented with videos, images, and other multimedia.

* Knowledge posts are meant to be useful for reference.&#x20;
* Knowledge posts are time-stamped and allow users to comment, like, and share with other team members.

#### News Channels&#x20;

Any channel in the Studio labeled "News" is intended for **dynamic, short-lifespan content**. News posts remain on the user's radar for a brief time and eventually disappear due to inactivity or lost relevance. The brief lifespan of the content does not mean it is less important than other content, only that the relevance is limited. News posts often create a high level of social interactions (comments and likes) making this content very dynamic. As new News Posts are created, they replace older content in the newsfeed. Unless a news post is [unpublished](https://support.staffbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027939932-Unpublishing-a-Post) or [deleted](https://app.gitbook.com/u/VqX9g9NW4XYb9zu0rPyEiduFyhV2), it is still available via search.&#x20;

* News posts are time-stamped and allow users to comment, like, and share with other team members.
