## The Framework: Internal email updates

With several offices and many projects around the country, team member communication is paramount to Robins & Morton’s success in maintaining the family atmosphere that we have spent nearly 80 years cultivating. From company recognition, awards, to updates from our Building Forward® initiative, the marketing and communications department works to provide the most up-to-date information on the goings-on on our projects and in our offices. We accomplish this through our weekly newsletter called The Framework that arrives in inboxes every Monday.
