# Marketing Events Calendar

Marketing team members are responsible for working with the Operations Managers to maintain the Corporate Events Calendar. This calendar includes all project and industry events and is used at executive level meetings. The calendar also helps division leaders coordinate support for events that may be a strategic opportunity for more than one division (ex. Industry networking event for various healthcare clients).&#x20;
