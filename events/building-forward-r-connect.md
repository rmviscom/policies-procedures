# Building Forward® Connect

Building Forward<sup>®</sup> Connect is Robins & Morton’s signature companywide event designed to bring together team members and their families from across the country for two days of learning, leadership development, and social connection.&#x20;

Held every few years in Orlando, Connect serves as a unique opportunity for employees to engage in collaborative workshops, share innovative ideas, and strengthen relationships both professionally and personally.&#x20;

The event is a cornerstone of our Building Forward<sup>®</sup> culture, which emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, leadership development, and building a learning culture.&#x20;

Through a blend of educational sessions and social activities, Connect reinforces our commitment to empowering individuals at every level, fostering inclusion, and driving innovation throughout our organization.
