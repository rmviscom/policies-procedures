## Client Gifts

Each holiday season, Robins & Morton provides a custom-designed corporate gift to show our appreciation to clients and key partners.  Gifts typically range from $150-300 per recipient.&#x20;

Each October, company leaders receive a list of potential gift recipients from Marketing, and are asked to review and update contacts and their delivery addresses.

Gifts are distributed in early December to ensure arrival by the end of the month.&#x20;

For past client gift examples and overviews, please reach out to [Amanda Bradley Witteck](mailto:abradley@robinsmorton.com).

## Team Member Gifts

#### Salaried Team

To show our appreciation to our salaried team members, Robins & Morton provides a series of gift options team members can choose during our yearly “Choose your Cheer” campaign.&#x20;

The first week of November, team members receive an email from Amanda Bradley Witteck inviting them to select their holiday gift from 4-5 items.&#x20;

**Team members have a week to select a gift.** If they do not select a gift in the allotted time frame, a standard option will be sent to the address HR has on file for that team member.&#x20;

All salaried team member gifts are distributed the first week of December.&#x20;

#### Hourly Team

Robins & Morton also offers the option to appreciate our long-time and outstanding hourly team members at this time of year by sending an order form and appreciation card to senior site contacts and Managers to distribute as they see fit.&#x20;

If you have any questions or concerns about the team member gifting process, please reach out to [Amanda Bradley Witteck](mailto:abradley@robinsmorton.com).
