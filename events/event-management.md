## **Collaboration**

While the Marketing team holds the primary responsibility for event management, collaboration with the Communications team and Graphic Design team is essential for the delivery of specific tactical elements. The Marketing team should proactively engage these teams as needed to leverage their expertise and ensure a cohesive and comprehensive event experience.

All teams involved in event management must adhere to this policy and any related procedures to ensure a unified approach to company events and trade shows.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Purpose**

This policy defines the roles and responsibilities related to the management of all events – including office open houses, celebrations, and milestones – and trade shows within the organization.

The Marketing team is designated as the lead department for the management of all events and trade shows. The team is responsible for the overall coordination, planning, and execution of these events to ensure they align with the company's strategic goals and brand image. Please see below for roles and responsibilities.
