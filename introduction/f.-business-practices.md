# F. Business Practices

## 1. Fair Treatment of Everyone

We will treat everyone we deal with fairly. A good test of how we measure up is to use the “Golden Rule,” to assess the way we treat customers, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors.

Our customers’ interest is first, even when it may cost Robins & Morton money or lost profits. We will deal with our customers, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors honestly and respectfully. Above all, we must conduct our business in such a way that our actions will be viewed as fair and ethical in every situation.

## 2. Gift and Entertainment - (Both giving and receiving.)

A. Gifts and entertainment for clients is an accepted practice in our industry. We will use good judgement by providing gifts that are a thoughtful reminder of our appreciation for the relationship we have with a client or business organization. For some years we have sent the “Fruit of the Month” to selected clients. These gifts have cemented good will and constitute a legitimate use of our funds. We will make certain that our business gifts do not violate policies of our customers. If ever the occasion arises where another type of gift might be appropriate, please discuss it with your manager. Any “extraordinary” gift must be approved in advance.

Business entertainment situations vary widely in cost and effectiveness. One test that has served our company well over the years is to invest our personal time, along with any entertainment activities. For instance, tickets to an event for both you and the client are almost always an acceptable form of entertainment. Use common sense.

B. Gifts and entertainment of nominal value may be accepted by our employees from our clients, suppliers, vendors and subcontractors; however, we must avoid the appearance of improper influence, by accepting gifts of unusual value. One test that can be used is, if a competitor of a vendor learned of the gift, could it possibly be viewed as a bribe or kickback. Any gift in excess of $100.00 in value must be reported to your manager. Each questionable situation will be different - if in doubt, discuss it with your manager.

## 3. Use of Company Assets

Company assets are for company use. This is an especially important consideration in our business. The equipment, tools, supplies and materials we purchase at job sites are to be used on the job. The rules for disposition of left over or unused materials are spelled out in our Policies and Procedures Manual. You should follow them or get approval for an exception.

The more difficult questions are borrowing the company truck for an hour to haul some stuff from your most recent home project to the local dump or using the office copier to make copies of your special fried chicken recipe for the members of your Sunday school class. Provided the Company is not compromised in any way, exceptions may be made – with prior notice – for the limited use of company assets. In each instance, your manager must provide prior approval.

## 4. Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest exists when your actions on the job could benefit either you or another individual or organization, at the expense of Robins & Morton. As an employee of Robins & Morton you should always avoid any situations where even the appearance of a conflict of interest is present.

Awarding a contract to or purchasing an item from a family member might create the impression of a conflict of interest. In these situations, we must make sure the cost is consistent with the cost of acquiring the product or service from any other supplier. Any contract for services or purchase of goods from family members must be approved in advance by your senior manager.

Annually, every officer and manager of the company will disclose, in writing, to the President a list of companies which are competitors, potential competitors, subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers and in which he or she, or a member of his or her family, has a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in excess of $5,000.00. In addition, if an officer or manager has a close relative (parent, child, sibling, and spouse) employed by a competitor, potential competitor, subcontractor, vendor, or supplier, then the names(s) and position(s) of that relative shall be disclosed. The purpose of these mandatory disclosures is to make certain Robins & Morton is aware of any circumstances which might create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Any question about disclosure will be resolved in favor of disclosure.

Another type of potential conflict of interest can arise in the employment of family members. Before any member of an employee’s family (parent, child, sibling, and spouse) is hired in any capacity, the hiring manager must secure approval from his or her senior manager.

There are so many potential conflicts of interest situations that they are too numerous to list. A guiding principle should be to determine in any situation, in advance, if a conflict or the appearance of a conflict may exist. The best way to accomplish this is to discuss the specific situation with your manager before you take action.

## 5. Illegal and Unethical Acts

The company will not tolerate theft, fraud, embezzlement, kickbacks, falsification of records, or any other illegal act on the part of an employee. Unethical acts such as inflated billings, misrepresentation of facts, concealment of errors, illegal political contributions, or misuse of company assets, will also be grounds for dismissal.

## 6. Violations of Law

While Robins & Morton does not construct facilities internationally, some of our business dealings nonetheless involve dealings with foreign nationals and, from time to time, foreign officials. Neither Robins & Morton nor any of its employees shall offer, make, promise, or authorize payments to Foreign Officials, directly or indirectly, which would violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention, or similar laws. Furthermore, Robins & Morton will not condone or tolerate the offering, making, or authorizing of such payments by any agent or third party who purports to act on behalf of the Company. Robins & Morton is committed to maintaining its books and records in reasonable detail to reflect transactions and dispositions of assets accurately and fairly. No director, officer, employee, or agent will suffer adverse consequences for refusing to pay bribes even if the refusal results or could result in our losing business. The FCPA and these related anti-bribery provisions are highly technical. Please refer any questions regarding these requirements to our Chief Financial Officer for guidance.
