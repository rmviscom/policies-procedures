# TITLE

Preconstruction Services

# PURPOSE

To ensure R&M provides the agreed to/or requested preconstruction
services prior to the start of a project, controls risk, and protects
the targeted project profit.

# RESPONSIBILITY

Operations Manager

# STATEMENT

Preconstruction services include any and all activities provided prior
to the actual construction of a project. Preconstruction services
include, but are not limited to, planning, estimating, cost management,
subcontractor development, strategy, and effective communication with
the team. This is the time to set the project up for success by
controlling the design, identifying and managing risks, maximizing
profit, and developing strong relationships with our client
representatives. The Operations Manager should work closely with the
client and lead the overall preconstruction effort to ensure the
established goals are met. (Refer to [OP-020.1 Preconstruction
Activities
Matrix](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/policies-procedures/OP-020.1%20Preconstruction%20Activities%20Matrix.xlsx)
for a guide to preconstruction activities at various design stages.)

# POLICY

To ensure overall project profitability and success by providing
effective leadership during preconstruction and by performing the
following activities (minimum).

1.  The Operations Manager shall conduct a preconstruction kick-off
    meeting with the R&M team to establish strategies, work assignments,
    and reinforce client expectations (refer to [Policy OP-030
    Preconstruction Services Kickoff Meeting
    Intracompany](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-030%20Precon%20Services%20Kickoff%20Meeting%20Intercompany/OP-030%20Precon%20Services%20Kickoff%20Meeting%20Intercompany.docx)).
    The R&M team should include the Operations Manager, Project
    Director, Estimators, Superintendent, and Project Manager.

2.  Develop an estimate appropriately prepared, based on the level of
    detail and progress of design, along with a strategic risk reward
    contingency management plan (refer to [Policies OP-180 Preliminary
    Estimate](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-180%20Preliminary%20Estimate/OP-180%20Preliminary%20Estimate.docx)
    and [OP-190 Final Job Cost
    Estimate](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-190%20Final%20Job%20Cost%20Estimate/OP-190%20Final%20Job%20Cost%20Estimate.docx)).

3.  Prepare an overall preconstruction schedule including design
    activities (refer to [Policy OP-050 Preconstruction Phase
    Scheduling](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-050%20Preconstruction%20Phase%20Scheduling/OP-050%20Preconstruction%20Phase%20Scheduling.docx)).

4.  Prepare a preconstruction services staffing plan with
    responsibilities for each individual.

5.  Actively pursue and evaluate opportunities for self-performed work
    (refer to Self-Perform Work (SPW) Protocol). Reference Protocols on
    HUB.

6.  Prepare a site logistics and utilization plan (refer to [Policy
    OP-110 Proposed Site Logistics and Utilization
    Plan](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-110%20Proposed%20Site%20Logistics%20and%20Utilization%20Plan/OP-110%20Proposed%20Site%20Logistics%20and%20Utilization%20Plan.docx)).

7.  Establish, along with the client and design team, the dates and
    agenda for preconstruction team meetings.

8.  Develop a specific overall team strategy to ensure project success.

9.  Evaluate and pursue opportunities for prefabrication and modular
    construction.

10. Lead the preconstruction process to ensure adequate design
    information at each stage of design to allow for the most
    comprehensive and accurate estimates possible. Refer to the
    Checklists for Schematic Design ([Form
    OP-020.2](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/policies-procedures/OP-020.2%20Schematic%20Design%20Checklist.xlsx)),
    Design Development ([Form
    OP-020.3](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/policies-procedures/OP-020.3%20Design%20Development%20Checklist.xlsx)),
    and Final Design ([Form
    OP-020.4](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/policies-procedures/OP-020.4%20Final%20Design%20Documents%20Checklist.xlsx))
    as a guide to ensure the required information is included at the
    various stages of design.

11. Identify and actively solicit the appropriate subcontractors and
    vendors to ensure competitive pricing from the most qualified
    bidders. It is important to recognize there are appropriate
    subcontractors and vendors for different types of work as well as
    the need to be appropriate for the geographic region of the project.

12. Ensure subcontractors and vendors are appropriate for the specific
    type of project delivery (IPD, cost plus, hard dollar, etc.).

13. Prior to soliciting and using early pricing feedback from
    subcontractors, the preconstruction leader or a person designated by
    the Operations Manager, will ensure the subcontractor meets [Policy
    OP-170 Subcontractor
    Qualification](file:///Users/ginnyfowler/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheRobins&MortonGroup/OP-170%20Subcontractor%20Qualification/OP-170%20Subcontractor%20Qualification.docx).
    Obtaining pricing from non-qualified subcontractors is not effective
    in establishing pricing to manage risk.

14. The Operations Manager, Project Director, Senior Project Manager,
    and the Director of Contract Administration will evaluate the
    proposed contract. The Operations Manager will ensure the estimate
    is developed in accordance with the contract terms to maximize
    profits and mitigate the risk associated with the contract terms as
    much as possible.
