# Design Templates

InDesign templates for proposals are located here:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
/Shared/Marketing Department/Sales/Templates/Proposal Templates
```
{% endcode %}

This folder includes documents with margins for printing, with margins for digital delivery, double-sided print, and horizontal options.&#x20;

You will also see a document with just covers and section page design options.&#x20;

## Book Files

The Book Files folder is useful if you are working closely with another marketer on an RFP. We can set up each section as its own InDesign file so that two people can work on different parts of the document at the same time. Reach out to [Ginny Fowler](mailto:ginny.fowler@robinsmorton.com) for support.

## Matrix Templates

### Exporting data from Unanet

Our teams frequently want to include a matrix in a proposal showing which team members have worked together before. To simplify this process, follow these steps.

#### Step 1

To create a matrix, start by **exporting the data you need from Unanet**. [A report template has been created for you.](https://services.cosential.com/reports20/ReportsResults.cfm?ReportID=KbRP9DzEHLYWuusGkvUL4lriEgkQ~~\&ReportTypeID=1)

You can customize to add fields you need (currently contains Project Name, Construction Schedule - Calc Start Date, Construction Schedule - Calc End Date, Staff Team Name, Project Number, Size - Building Size, Final (or Current) Contract PC) and on the second page of the customization, you will add your team members here, make sure include in main query is checked as shown:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you've downloaded your report, delete extraneous data from the Excel sheet and share with your team for changes.&#x20;

#### Step 2

Upload to CoPilot or ChatGPT and use this prompt:

I am uploading a spreadsheet containing \[a list of projects] and \[the teams who have worked on them]. Create a matrix to display which team members have worked on which project. Show the projects as headers in each column, and the team members as headers in each row. Use X to mark the overlap. Provide a downloadable spreadsheet when finished.

#### Step 3

This folder:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
/Shared/Marketing Department/Sales/Templates/Proposal Templates/Matrix Templates
```
{% endcode %}

contains templates for creating a data matrix in InDesign.&#x20;
