# Proposal Printing

## Prepping files

Confirm whether your printer prefers you to send print-ready PDFs or packaged InDesign files. Most will want print-ready PDFs. Also confirm whether they want you to include crop marks, or just bleeds.

<summary>Check the InDesign Preflight panel and fix errors</summary>

The preflight panel checks for **missing or broken links** and **overset text.**&#x20;

1. Open the panel by going to **Window > Output > Preflight**

* Preflight is also available in the InDesign window footer if you have Preflight Document checked

2. Review any errors and fix

<summary>Check bleeds</summary>

If your bleeds are not set up correctly, the printer will have to ask you how you want to handle. This takes extra time and can delay production.

If you are using our proposal templates, your document should be set to have .125" bleeds all the way around. You'll see a red line around the outside of your pages in InDesign.

<div align="center"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 10.42.13 AM.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Your document should show a red line outside of each page. This is how far any photos or colors that bleed off the edge should extend in your file.</p></figcaption></figure></div>



If your document doesn't have bleeds set up and some of your art DOES bleed off the page, go to **File > Document Setup** and add 0.125 in to your bleed on all sides.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 10.47.25 AM.png" alt="" width="209"><figcaption><p>Enter .125 in all fields on the Bleed row if needed.</p></figcaption></figure>



You can preview your document including the bleeds by going to **View > Screen Mode > Bleed**

Scroll through your document and make sure that any photos or colors that are meant to bleed off the page reach all the way to the bleed line.

<summary>Export a print-ready PDF</summary>

You can ask your printer for exactly how they want this set up, but the steps below are generally acceptable.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Shortcut

You can install these two PDF presents that will export a print-ready PDF with bleeds — or with bleeds and crop marks — in a single click.&#x20;

Download the files to your desktop then in InDesign, go to **File > Adobe PDF Presets > Define... > Load...**

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Press Quality Crops Bleeds.joboptions" %}

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Press Quality Bleeds.joboptions" %}
{% endhint %}



1. In InDesign, go to **File > Adobe PDF Presets** and select \[Press Quality]

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 10.59.07 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



2. Click Save in the location you're saving your file.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Best practice

When you're saving a PDF for printing and including bleeds, add "**\_bleeds**" onto the end of the filename. This lets the printer know the file has been saved appropriately.&#x20;

If your printer wants crop marks as well, add "**\_cropsandbleeds**"
{% endhint %}



3. In the next window, select the Marks and Bleeds tab on the left. Check the "Use Document Bleed Settings" box.

* If your printer specifically requests crop marks to be included, check the Crop Marks box here too.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-09 at 11.01.17 AM.png" alt="" width="337"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Click Export.
5. Open your exported file to ensure it is correct.

## Printing in-house

If your office is equipped, you can print and assemble proposals yourself and ship them directly.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
## Best Practice

Leave yourself more time than you think you'll need to print, assemble, and ship proposals. **A full day is ideal,** but no less than four hours.
{% endhint %}

***

## Sending to an external print vendor

Proposals are a specialty item because they require manual assembly, are usually being ordered in small quantities, and the files are typically delivered at the very last minute. All of this requires your print shop to be prepared to drop everything and work on your project at a moment's notice.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Best Practice

Build a relationship with a local vendor you can trust. Don't wait until the last minute to vet a new printer.

**Things to look for:** their ability to print custom tabs if needed, or process for getting them Robins & Morton printed tabs; turnaround times they require; ability to ship proposals for you.

### Overcommunicate! Better to bug them than have something fall through the cracks.
{% endhint %}

#### Email your vendor as soon as you know a reasonable amount about the order you want to place. Here is an example of what to say.

> Hi \[rep],
>
> We would like to order some printed proposals to be assembled and shipped from your facility. Specifications are below. Please confirm that this is possible given the specs and timeline, and let me know if there is anything else we need to consider.
>
> **We plan to deliver the print-ready PDF to you by 3pm on September 9. Finished proposals must be postmarked by September 10.**&#x20;
>
>
>
> * **Pages:** 40
> * **Final size:** 8.5 x 11 - there are a few 11 x 17 pages that need to be folded in to fit the final 8.5 x 11 size
> * **Quantity:** 5 with instructions below
> * **Binding:** Spiral bound on left side/long side&#x20;
> * **Cover and tabs:** Tabs, clear covers and black presentation backs were shipped to the Birmingham ARC office on 9/3
> * **Delivery:** They need to be postmarked by 9/9 and delivered by Tuesday 9/14, no specified time
>   * 1 copy to \[name, address]
>   * 5 copies to \[name, address]
