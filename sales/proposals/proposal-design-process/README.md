# Proposal Design Process

## Before you begin

Consider your requirements and preferences before choosing a horizontal or vertical template.



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open template file


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add client and project name to the cover

These elements are automatically added to the footer of each page
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create tab pages for each section

Replace Section Header with the section titles from your RFP. Duplicate the tab page and repeat for each section in the document.

{% hint style="info" %}
All text using the **Section Header** paragraph style will appear in the Table of Contents.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Use the **condensed section** templates when you have a limited page count.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create placeholder pages for known content

Use parent pages to adjust page sizes as needed.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Drop in any existing PDF inclusions

Corporate documents can be found here: [https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/folder/4dee6826-6a8d-49be-aa1d-6bb31d71b8ab](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/folder/4dee6826-6a8d-49be-aa1d-6bb31d71b8ab)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Request org charts, resumes, custom designs as needed from the graphics team


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Begin inserting custom content as received


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Customize paragraph styles to fit your needs

**The \_Body paragraph style is the base for your document.** By default the font is 9pt size and 12pt leading. If you have space restrictions, you can edit the paragraph style to be 8pt/10pt.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Customize colors to fit your needs

The proposal templates include a folder with four color swatches labeled Client Colors. You can edit these to match your client's brand colors, and those will update throughout the document.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Keep styles and colors consistent and clean

New styles and colors will be added to your document as you insert content from the CC Libraries or other proposals. Keep an eye on your palettes and merge duplicates as a best practice. For example, if you have a "\_Body" paragraph style and a "Body" paragraph style, you can delete the "Body" style. InDesign will prompt you to choose another style to replace it with; you can select the base" _\__&#x42;ody" style.

This same principal applies to colors. If you have a color called CMYK Red 2347 and one called CMYK 2347, you can delete one and at the prompt, tell InDesign to replace all instances of the deleted color with the other.&#x20;
