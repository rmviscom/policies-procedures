# Design Templates and Layouts

## Base Templates

### How to use Base Templates

1. Choose which file best suits your needs (standard, condensed, facing pages, or A3 pages).
2. Open the template file, and save the document to your Opportunity folder.
3. Enter the name of the project and name of the client on the Cover.&#x20;
4. Using your document outline, create all tab pages.
5. Create placeholder pages for future content.
6. Begin compiling project-specific content and entering it into your document.



## Layouts

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Layouts vs. Boilerplate

#### Layout files ARE NOT boilerplate content - they are frameworks for laying out original, project-specific content.

In most instances, text has been replaced with greeking to prevent out of date content from being used.
{% endhint %}

To import a pre-existing layout:

1. Open the file containing the layout you want.
2. Select the page layout you want to import.
3. Cmd-a to select all elements on the page. Copy/paste onto a page in your master proposal file.
4. In your pages panel, right click the page you want to import. Choose Move Pages... Select the page you want to move, the document you want to move it to, and the location.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using the Move Pages function does not delete the page in the source document by default. Please leave "Delete Pages After Moving" **unchecked.**
{% endhint %}



## Boilerplate

```
Shared/Marketing Department/Sales/Templates/Proposal Templates/#Boilerplate
```

Boilerplate content is generic text that is approved for publishing by the communications team. Joist can be used to access boilerplate content. Some boilerplate content exists as InDesign files that can be pulled into your proposals as is.&#x20;
