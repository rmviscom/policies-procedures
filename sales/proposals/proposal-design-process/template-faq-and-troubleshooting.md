# Template FAQ and Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>Layers</summary>

Our templates contain 3 distinct layers:

1. **Artboard notes:** This is a [non-printing layer](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/layers.html#set_a_layer_as_nonprinting). These are notes from the graphics team to help you use the template. You can hide the layer from the Layers panel if you prefer not to see them.
2. **Header Footer:** This layer is above the Content layer so that the header and footer (including page numbers) always appear on top of whatever graphic or images you put there.
3. **Content:** This layer is where all of your content should go.

You can add layers to your document as needed.

<summary>Table of Contents</summary>

Our templates include a Table of Contents that can be updated to automatically show the Section Headers from tab pages along with their correct page numbers.&#x20;

When the TOC is automatically generated and you export the document as an interactive PDF, the TOC items will be clickable.

[Learn more about Table of Contents.](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/creating-table-contents.html)

The Table of Contents can also be created manually by typing in your section titles and the correct page numbers. If you manually type in the TOC items and page numbers, they will not be clickable in an interactive PDF.

### How to update the automatically generated PDF

Go to the menu: Layout > Update Table of Contents.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 12.27.34 AM.png" alt="" width="152"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

InDesign searches the document for text using the Section Header paragraph style and inserts that text in to the TOC along with the appropriate page number.

The items in the TOC use the TOC1 paragraph style.

### Troubleshooting

* If you update the Table of Contents and the styles look wrong (text in different colors, etc.) select the text, go to Character Styles, and click \[None]
* If items are missing from the TOC after updating, check the tab pages and make sure your section headers are using the Section Header paragraph style.
* If items you don't expect are in the TOC after updating, find the text in your document and change the paragraph style to something other than Section Header.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Updating the Table of Contents should be the last thing you do before exporting.

<summary>Tab pages</summary>

Tab pages separate sections of your document.&#x20;

**Automations:** Section Headers on tab pages are used to dynamically generate the Table of Contents - if you delete all of your tab pages, your TOC will be empty. [Learn more about generating TOCs in InDesign.](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/creating-table-contents.html)

{% hint style="info" %}
The details below refer to section divider pages included in our InDesign templates. To order Robins & Morton branded physical tabs with numbered or alphabetical tab label, visit the Index Tabs section of our [Hemlock portal](https://order.hemlock.com/robinsmorton).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Best practice

When creating your proposal document, select a tab page layout, then duplicate that page to create other tab pages.
{% endhint %}

### Default Tab Pages

<div align="center"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 4.26.20 PM.png" alt="" width="271"><figcaption><p>Example: vertical tab page</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 4.44.39 PM.png" alt="" width="362"><figcaption><p>Example: horizontal tab page</p></figcaption></figure></div>

**Size:** 8.5"x11"

**When to use:** Standalone tab pages are best when you do not have a hard page limit, or it's explicitly stated that tab pages do not count towards the overall page count.

**Section Header:** Replace this text with the title of your section. **This text (using the Section Header paragraph style) is used to automatically generate the Table of Contents.** If you change the paragraph style to something other than Section Header, it will not appear in the TOC.&#x20;

The running section headers on your content pages also update automatically based on the last Section Header paragraph style.&#x20;

<div data-full-width="false" data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 4.17.13 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Running Section Header on content page - this text will automatically update to match the text in the last used Section Header paragraph style (used on tab pages).</p></figcaption></figure></div>

**Other content:** Tab pages can be used to emphasize your hook, show photos of our people, highlight testimonials, or promote relevant awards.&#x20;

### Condensed Tab Page

If your proposal has a hard page limit, you may want to use condensed tab pages. These also include a Section Header that pulls into the TOC and flows down to the running section headers - but rather than being a standalone hero page, they allow you to include body content.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Use a single tab page style throughout your document - either the default page or condensed.
{% endhint %}

<div><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 4.33.03 PM.png" alt="" width="272"><figcaption><p>Example Vertical Condensed Tab Page</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-05 at 8.01.14 AM.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Example Horizontal Condensed Tab Page</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-05 at 8.03.31 AM.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Example 11x17 Condensed Tab Page</p></figcaption></figure></div>

**Size:** 8.5"x11" and 11"x17" (for proposals that are all A3 pages)

**When to use:** Use condensed pages if you have a hard page limit and standalone tab pages are not excluded from the page count.

**Section Header:** Condensed tab pages still include text in the Section Header paragraph style, but the text also has a character style applied to make it smaller and red. As with the default page, if you change the paragraph style to something other than Section Header, your TOC and running page headers will fail to work correctly.

### 9"x11" Vertical Tab Pages

We have a custom parent page that has the same layout as the default tab pages, but the page is slightly wider than the 8.5"x11" content pages. This is for printed tabs that you want to stick out past the content pages when bound.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are printing 9"x11" tabs, have those pages printed on cardstock rather than regular paper.
{% endhint %}

<summary>Headings</summary>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/MicrosoftTeams-image-53-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The purpose of headings is to allow readers to skim the page and still understand the overall meaning.&#x20;

The organization of your header styles should correspond to your content outline. Larger headers represent higher level sections, with smaller headings below. This allows the user to visually understand the organization of the content.

| Your outline                                                                                                                                              | Your layout                                                                                                                              |

## Best practice

Your readers should understand your most important points even if they only read the headings.=

<summary>RFP Questions</summary>

Questions are quoted in our proposals to help the client understand the organization of the content.&#x20;

There are multiple paragraph styles designated for quoting the questions found in your RFP. **Question formatting should be consistent within your document** - all of your quoted questions should use the same paragraph style.
