## QC Script for InDesign

We have created an InDesign script that will automatically correct many grammar and style issues, and flag many others that need attention.&#x20;

The script can be modified as needs arise; please reach out to [Ginny Fowler](mailto:ginny.fowler@robinsmorton.com) for help or with suggestions.
