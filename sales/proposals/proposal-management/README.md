# Proposal Management

**Marketing owns this process—from the moment an RFP is received through submittal—ensuring consistency, efficiency, and quality across all pursuits.**

Marketing leads:

* **RFP analysis and workbook setup**
* **Kickoff meeting facilitation**
* **Timeline creation and accountability tracking**
* **Content coordination and submittal**
* **File management and communication**

## Best Practices

* **Lead, don’t facilitate.** Marketing owns the process. Keep meetings focused, assertive, and outcome-driven.
* **Schedule kickoff fast.** Hold it within 72 hours of receiving the RFP—don’t wait on indecision.
* **Use the workbook as the single source of truth.** Keep it open in every meeting and use it as your agenda.
* **Color-code and annotate.** Visual organization reduces confusion.
* **Push for realistic dates.** Ask team members to check their calendars before committing.
* **Be transparent about capacity.** Add vacations and competing deadlines directly in the workbook.
* **Record and share.** Save meeting recordings and notes in Egnyte for reference.
* **Educate as you go.** Use deadlines and questions as teachable moments about the proposal process.
* **Close the loop.** Always document lessons learned for future pursuits.

## Common Pitfalls

* **Delaying the kickoff meeting** → Compresses timelines and forces last-minute scrambles.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x41;lways schedule within 72 hours of receiving the RFP._
* **Letting others drive the meeting** → Creates confusion and weakens marketing’s leadership role.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4D;arketing should always share the screen and lead the agenda._
* **Skipping the workbook setup** → Leads to disorganization, missed requirements, and rework.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;omplete the Proposal Workbook before scheduling the kickoff._
* **Accepting unrealistic due dates** → Results in missed deadlines and rushed quality.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x41;sk participants to check their calendars and confirm realistic commitments._
* **Failing to follow up** → Content stalls and accountability disappears.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x48;old consistent check-ins and use Monday.com reminders to keep momentum._
* **Ignoring the workbook after kickoff** → Visibility is lost and details slip through.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x55;se the workbook as a live management tool through submittal._
* **Requesting graphics too late** → Bottlenecks design and delays finalization.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x49;dentify visual needs early and capture them in the Support column._
* **Over-focusing on design too soon** → Wastes time on unfinished or changing content.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x50;rioritize written content first, then refine design once text is stable._

{% step %}
### RFP Intake

* [ ] Save all RFP materials in Egnyte:\
  `/Shared/Marketing Department/Opportunities/[Client]/[Opportunity Number]_[ProjectName]/Client`
* [ ] Create a new Monday.com item on the [RM Sales Pursuits board](https://robinsmorton-global.monday.com/boards/4259861171).
  * Add key dates, opportunity name, and sales lead.
  * Link the Egnyte folder and workbook.
* [ ] Skim the RFP immediately—**don’t wait for the kickoff**. Note:
  * Due date
  * Submittal format (electronic, printed, both)
  * Questions deadline
  * Evaluation/scoring criteria
  * Any unusual or strict requirements


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Build the Proposal Workbook

{% hint style="success" %}
## Pro Tip

Complete this before the kickoff—ideally within 30 minutes of reading the RFP. It’s faster than it sounds and makes the kickoff _infinitely_ smoother.
{% endhint %}

Use the [standardized Excel workbook](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/file/3d788cdc-2a73-4f6c-a95e-4a53aadec72b) stored in Egnyte:\
`/Shared/Marketing Department/Sales/Strategy/Toolbox/Proposal Worksheet Template`

**The workbook is the central management tool for all proposal information.**

Populate three tabs:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Tab</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Key Content</th><th>Best Practice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Production Info (Calendar)</strong></td><td>Visual timeline of proposal tasks</td><td>Due dates, RFI deadline, submittal date, holidays, team PTO, related events</td><td><em>Always include vacations, OM meetings, travel, and client events. Visual overlap helps identify conflicts early.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proposal Outline</strong></td><td>Content structure and assignments</td><td>RFP questions (copied verbatim), section leads, due dates, notes</td><td><p><em>Color-code:</em> </p><p><mark style="background-color:yellow;">Yellow</mark> = section header <mark style="background-color:green;">Green</mark> = separate deliverable</p><p><mark style="background-color:purple;">Purple</mark> = marketing content. </p><p>Add “Support” column for graphics/design.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Requirements &#x26; Questions</strong></td><td>RFP compliance and open issues</td><td>Submittal instructions, page limits, formatting rules, scoring criteria, login credentials, questions to client</td><td><em>Include portal logins, file size limits, naming conventions, and RFP clarification questions.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Schedule and Lead the Kickoff Meeting

* **Timing:** Schedule within **72 hours of receiving the RFP.**
* **Invite:**
  * [ ] Sales lead and key operational staff
  * [ ] Preconstruction if pricing or design input is required
  * [ ] VDC or Logistics if relevant
  * [ ] Marketing team members assigned to support
* **Include in invite:**
  * [ ] Link to **Egnyte Opportunity folder**
  * [ ] Link to **Proposal Workbook**
  * [ ] Benchmark or past example proposals (if helpful)
* **Meeting length:** Aim for 60 minutes; typically finishes in 30–45.

#### **During the Call:**

{% hint style="success" %}
## **Pro Tip**&#x20;

At each check-in, **share your screen** and work directly from the workbook to guide the conversation. Don’t let the team drift into unrelated discussions—stay focused on deliverables.
{% endhint %}

Use the Proposal Workbook as your agenda. **Marketing leads the call and controls the screen.**

* [ ] **Start with the Calendar tab.**
  * Confirm RFP due dates and internal milestones.
  * Ask each participant to declare known PTO, travel, or conflicts.
  * Identify check-in call cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, daily for short turnarounds).
* [ ] **Review unusual requirements.**
  * Submittal format (print/electronic)
  * Page limits, scoring, fonts, forms, portal credentials.
* [ ] **Walk through the Proposal Outline tab.**
  * Assign owners to each section.
  * Record due dates (ask for realistic ones, verify against calendar).
  * Note marketing-owned boilerplate sections (e.g., safety, QA/QC).
  * Add a **Support column** for graphics, editing, and other marketing inputs.
* [ ] **Capture discussion points.**
  * Project themes, differentiators, and key messages.
  * Clarify anything ambiguous in the RFP.
* [ ] **Record and save notes** if possible for reference.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Post-Kickoff Management

* **Email the workbook** (finalized with assignments and due dates) to all participants.
* **Add tasks to Monday.com** for each deliverable.
* **Set reminders** for follow-up and interim drafts.
* **Hold short check-ins** (15–30 min) as needed to maintain accountability.

Use the workbook as a **living document**:

* Update dates as things shift.
* Gray out or color-code completed sections.
* Add notes for late or pending items.
* Record key decisions, client updates, and new deadlines.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Submittal and Closeout

* [ ] **Finalize formatting and QA.**
  * Review all headers, page numbers, tabs, and compliance items.
  * Check print specs or upload instructions.
* [ ] **Save final versions in Egnyte:**\
  `/Opportunities/[Client]/[Opportunity Number]_[ProjectName]/06_Final_Submittal/`
* [ ] **Archive the workbook** with final notes.
* [ ] **Update Monday.com status** to “Submitted.”
* [ ] **Record Lessons Learned** (in Monday.com or shared notes file):
  * What worked / didn’t work
  * Team responsiveness
  * Client feedback or obstacles
{% endstep %}
