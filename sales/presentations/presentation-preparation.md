# Presentation Preparation

### **Goals**

* Create consistent, client-focused presentations across teams.
* Use structured tools and timelines to improve collaboration and clarity.
* Reduce last-minute reactivity and ensure adequate time for strategy and practice.
* Equip team members to present confidently and effectively.

### **Core Principles**

**1. Client first:**\
Every presentation must focus on the client’s needs, not our company’s history. Use client intelligence and decision-maker insight to shape the narrative.

**2. Start early:**\
Presentation planning begins before shortlisting — often while the proposal is still in progress.

**3. Consistency builds confidence:**\
Follow the same general structure (kickoff → content planning → practice → delivery → debrief) for every pursuit, _regardless of size or timeline._

**4. Use the tools:**\
The [_Presentation Workbook_](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/file/2f514805-7cba-4f74-8f1b-36695b66966f) is your single source of truth. Integrate it with the Strategic Pursuit Workbook and Proposal Workbook when appropriate.

**5. Progress over perfection:**\
The goal isn’t a “perfect” deck—it’s alignment, focus, and clarity. Use what fits the pursuit; skip what doesn’t.

### Common Pitfalls

* **Starting too late:** waiting until shortlisting compresses the timeline and lowers quality.
* **Overloading with “About Us” slides:** keep company slides minimal—lead with the client’s story.
* **Skipping practice:** even experienced presenters need structured rehearsal time.
* **Lack of clarity on roles:** always define who owns each slide, section, or talking point.
* **Neglecting follow-up:** the post-presentation debrief is critical for continuous improvement.

### Phase 1: Kickoff

#### **Objective**

Establish a shared understanding of the opportunity, timeline, audience, and strategic direction.

#### **Checklist**

* [ ] Schedule the **Presentation Kickoff Meeting** (block one hour).
* [ ] Invite: sales lead, operations lead, preconstruction, VDC, and other presenters.
* [ ] Share access to the Presentation Workbook.
* [ ] Add a calendar tab capturing:
  * Due dates and practice days
  * Major team conflicts (GMP presentations, site visits, etc.)
* [ ] Begin populating key workbook tabs:
  * Actions (to-do list)
  * Planning and Research (decision-maker and committee details)
  * Competition Analysis (use existing Strategic Pursuit data)
* [ ] Discuss preliminary **hook** and **win theme** ideas.

#### **Best Practices**

* Don’t wait for shortlisting—start prep while proposals are active.
* Invite technical partners early (e.g., precon or VDC) so they can plan deliverables.
* Capture non-negotiable conflicts now to avoid schedule chaos later.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Pro Tip

Use AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) with the workbook prompts to generate draft hooks and win themes. Iterate—don’t accept the first answer.
{% endhint %}


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Phase 2: Content Planning

#### **Objective**

Develop the core message and presentation structure using consistent frameworks.

#### **Checklist**

* [ ] Finalize the **hook** (the opening concept that captures the client’s attention).
* [ ] Define the **win theme** (why the client should choose your team).
* [ ] Identify 2–3 **keys to success** or strategic points.
* [ ] Use the **Talking Points** tab to outline:
  * Opening statement
  * Three main points with subpoints
  * Visuals and speaker assignments
  * Estimated time per section
* [ ] Share outlines with presenters for input.
* [ ] Incorporate relevant client intelligence from the Strategic Pursuit Workbook.
* [ ] Begin draft slides—focus on content flow before design.

#### **Best Practices**

* Keep content **client-focused**: address their goals, risks, and success metrics.
* Align with the sales lead early to confirm direction and tone.
* Use the “burger method” (hook → three main points → closing) for clear story flow.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Pro Tip

If team members struggle to focus their content, provide the **Burger Worksheet** template (see Toolbox Presentations folder). It simplifies complex talking points into a visual structure.
{% endhint %}


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Phase 3: Practice and Final Prep

#### **Objective**

Create structure, enforce accountability, and maximize productive practice time.

#### **Checklist**

* [ ] Collect **non-negotiable conflicts** from all participants (OACs, site meetings, etc.).
* [ ] Build and circulate a **daily practice schedule** (one day at a time).
* [ ] Include buffer time for phone calls, Q\&A workshopping, and breaks.
* [ ] Schedule full run-throughs and small-group Q\&A sessions.
* [ ] Encourage early submission of updated slides to maintain alignment.
* [ ] Print and distribute hard copies of the practice schedule each morning.
* [ ] Verify tech setup (clickers, monitors, Zoom connections, green screen if applicable).

#### **Best Practices**

* Allocate at least **50% of practice time to Q\&A**—real client conversations drive improvement.
* Keep practice days structured and visible; spontaneous sessions waste time.
* Don’t release the schedule too early—it invites negotiation. Print and post it the morning of.
* Encourage presenters to practice intros and transitions between speakers.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Pro Tip

If you’re working with field or precon staff who are less comfortable presenting, use simplified frameworks (like the Burger Worksheet) and one-on-one coaching to tighten messages.
{% endhint %}


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Phase 4: Presentation Delivery

#### **Objective**

Ensure smooth, confident execution with a unified client-focused message.

#### **Checklist**

* [ ] Confirm everyone has the latest deck version and handouts.
* [ ] Re-review the hook and win theme before presenting.
* [ ] Conduct a brief pre-meeting with presenters to align tone and timing.
* [ ] Manage time cues discreetly.
* [ ] Keep notes of any questions asked by the selection committee.

#### **Best Practices**

* Assign one marketer as **timekeeper and observer** during the interview.
* If virtual, test connections and backgrounds early and monitor the recording.
* Reinforce that the goal is conversation, not perfection—authenticity wins.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Phase 5: Post-Presentation Review

#### **Objective**

Capture insights, document improvements, and close the loop for future pursuits.

#### **Checklist**

* [ ] Schedule a **15–30 minute debrief** within 72 hours.
* [ ] Collect input from: sales lead, presenters, and marketing.
* [ ] Document:
  * Client feedback or committee comments
  * What resonated well
  * What needs improvement
  * Lessons for next time
* [ ] Update the **Presentation Workbook** and save to the intranet archive.
* [ ] Log key takeaways in the **Lessons Learned** tracker (in the Marketing SharePoint site).
* [ ] If awarded, note follow-up materials or client thank-you actions.

#### **Best Practices**

* Keep the debrief constructive and factual. Focus on process, not personalities.
* Archive all final materials—presentation deck, Q\&A log, and feedback—for future reference.
