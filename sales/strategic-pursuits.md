# Strategic Pursuits

The Strategic Pursuit Guide and Workbook were developed to support the efforts of our sales team—from seasoned sales leaders through those who are just beginning their business development journey. The guide is organized into three phases that mimic the typical life-cycle of a sales pursuit (Opening Game, Middle Game, End Game).

The workbook is a set of template tools that sales team members can use for their individual pursuit tracking.

Both the guide and the workbook can be accessed via the HUB link below, or by searching for "strategic pursuit".
