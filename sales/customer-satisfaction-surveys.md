## Project Selection

Each quarter, several recently completed projects are selected and surveyed by an outside resource, [FMI](https://fmicorp.com/consulting/c-services/market-research-due-diligence).&#x20;

The projects are selected by Robin Savage, and the projects that are surveyed are chosen to ensure a variety of project sizes, types, and possible repeat clients.&#x20;

## Process

FMI contacts a designated member from the client’s team who was actively engaged throughout the project (from preconstruction through warranty) to ensure they can provide the most valuable and informative feedback possible.

The Marketing and Communications Department is responsible for coordinating survey scheduling and completion with FMI. Once a project’s survey results are complete, they are initially shared with Bill Morton, Robin Savage, the operations manager or project executive for the project, Katy Klaproth and Farrah Mote.&#x20;

Farrah Mote then schedules a post-survey follow-up meeting with the preconstruction and operational team to review the survey data and discuss any areas of success or areas for possible improvement.&#x20;

If approved by the client, any comments shared by the client as a part of the survey response are also added to the project’s Unanet record.

## Reporting

The customer satisfaction report data is added to our quarterly [Customer Satisfaction PowerBI report](https://pbi.robinsmorton.com/reports/powerbi/Sales/Customer%20Satisfaction%20Report) that is shared monthly as a part of the Operations Managers Meeting and also shared quarterly as a part of the Board Meeting. This Power BI reports allows us to see trends in our survey scores and look for areas of strength and areas where we may need to spend more time/ focus on improvement.
