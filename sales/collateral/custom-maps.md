# Custom Maps

Our team uses the Google mapmaker tool to import location data from a CSV or XLS file and add points to a map.&#x20;

Go here: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/)

Use the import link to upload your CSV, and specify which columns to use for the location and pin names.

You can customize your pin color and shape.

To export, print to PDF.
