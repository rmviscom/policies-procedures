# Tracking and Reporting

## Pursuit process tracking

The pursuit process is tracked in the Monday board [RM Sales Pursuits](https://robinsmorton-global.monday.com/boards/4259861171).

All pursuits should also be added in Unanet including qualitative benchmarking scores, the RFQ/RFP, and our RFQ/RFP response, and presentation files.&#x20;

All Unanet opportunity records should also include the qualitative benchmarking score and the following information: repeat client opportunity, change order, hard bid effort, and strategic pursuit. If a fee was required as a part of our submission, please add the fee as well.



## Sales Reports

To provide a set of interactive sales tools, we have developed several Power BI reports for our sales team members to use and reference as needed. Below is a summary of each Power BI report, its purpose for the sales and marketing team and the location of each report.

{% hint style="info" %}
These reports are available on HUB under Marketing & Communications > Sales Support, or by searching "Sales Forecast"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**All of these reports require you to log in with your Robins & Morton email address and password.**
{% endhint %}



## Qualitative Benchmarking Policy

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
{% endcode %}

All opportunities that are at the 20% stage in Unanet need to have a completed AMC-030.1 (Qualitative Benchmarking Form). The sales leader, marketing team member, and any additional operational or preconstruction team members who are engaged in the sales effort need to complete form AMC-030.1. We also have an electronic version of the form if preferred.

## Sales Forecast Report

{% embed url="https://pbi.robinsmorton.com/reports/powerbi/Sales/Marketing_Sales_Meeting_Report" %}

The sales forecast report serves a the primary reporting tool for each corporate sales forecast meeting. The report includes a summary of each divisions sales goals and results, and the individual sales leaders opportunities and overall sales totals for tracking purposes.&#x20;

**All of the data utilized for the sales forecast report is pulled directly from the Unanet Opportunity record** including opportunity name, opportunity number, sales leader/ business developer, value, get percentage (0, 20, 80, 100), opportunity stage, and estimated start date.

This report is updated to align with the sales forecast meeting that is held every six weeks.

Some specific items to focus on during the sales forecast review period includes:

* **All sales opportunities through the meeting month need to be marked at 100%/08-Closed Won.** If you have any opportunities in the sales forecast meeting month (or prior) that are not at 100%, they need to be shifted out later in the year or shifted up to 100% to stay in the sales forecast month.
* **All sales opportunities need to be rounded to the nearest million.** For example – a sales opportunity that is $1.5 million should be rounded to $2 million, an opportunity that is $34.4 million should be rounded down to $34 million. Anything between $500,001 and $999,999 should be rounded to $1 million. Anything under $500,000 can be rounded to the nearest ten thousand ($250,000, $300,000, $150,000).
* **All sales opportunities need a designated sales leader to ensure the opportunity appears in the Power BI reports.** If there is no designated/tagged sales leader tied to an opportunity, it will not appear on our Power BI reports. Please contact Farrah Mote and Adria Klein with any new sales leaders so we can add them to our Power BI reports.
