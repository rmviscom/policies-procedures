# Business Planning

Each year, business planning occurs in late September through mid-October, with all final goals and budgets completed and approved by the December Business Planning meeting.

**It is important that Marketing and Communications Team members participate in the business planning process to ensure consistent information is being tracked in Unanet and then carried over to the business planning documents.** This includes opportunity name, number, value and sales forecast percentage (0, 20, 80, 100). Our department's participation in business planning is also a helpful learning experience so our team understands how the annual sales, profit, revenue goals are established, as well as how they affect our forecasting efforts.

We have developed a brief training of the business planning process for our marketing team that is available here:
