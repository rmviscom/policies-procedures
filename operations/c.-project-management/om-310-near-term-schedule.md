# OM-310 Near Term Schedule

## Discussion

Planning is the orderly arrangement of the activities and components in a construction project.  It is the responsibility of the Superintendent and Project Manager and is also one of the key elements in judging their performance.

To carry-out this responsibility, a procedure has been established that requires a collaborative approach utilizing input from subcontractors and other project stakeholders.   An internal scheduler or scheduling consultant will be engaged to assist\
in scheduling, utilizing Primavera P6 scheduling software, with\
an option to utilize Time Table in addition to and in conjunction with Primavera P6. (If an internal scheduler or scheduling consultant is not used, or if an alternate software is preferred,\
the Superintendent will obtain the Operations Manager’s and Project Director’s (if applicable) approval. The absence of an internal scheduler or a scheduling consultant does not change the elements and practices of this policy.)

In addition to reviewing this policy, the Project Manager will review the Owner Contract and project specifications to ensure that any project specific scheduling requirements are incorporated into our scheduling process.  If any scheduling requirements within the project specifications are in conflict with the Owner Contract, then our cost proposal to the Owner will be qualified accordingly.&#x20;

The responsibility for establishing the schedule, and planning and executing the work, remains with the Superintendent.

Refer to [OP-050.1 Planning and Scheduling Flow Chart](https://robinsmorton.egnyte.com/navigate/file/04d3e2cb-c61c-4407-b7f3-b57a55848d7c) for a visual representation of the flow of the planning and scheduling process.&#x20;

## Policy

1. A Near Term Schedule will be prepared beginning with the first work on the project.  A Near Term Schedule may be prepared for work to be done prior to starting work at the site.
2. The Near Term Schedule will be developed based on the current and near term activities identified on the Overall Project Schedule (reference examples [OM-310.1A Near Term Schedule P6 Example](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/operations/Ed3-P-v4EBNLgQB93E0O-oIBwLMnC6gU2S1GFeq_x7xXmw?e=LkYUfE) and [OM-310.1B Near Term Schedule Visio Example](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/operations/EewDtc3agJ1GvZ7E9TBXyNUBR-gDA0WZi8iUUklBoPjPNw?e=F4vMio)). All activities will be entered on time-scaled bars, including the description of each activity.\
   \
   Activities will not be over ten working days and preferably five working days.\
   \
   The Near Term Schedule will be prepared for ten weeks and will be updated and distributed to appropriate project team members every two weeks, and only after a formal schedule review meeting.
3. On an agreed-upon time and day, every two weeks a formal schedule review meeting will be conducted in the following format:
   1. A suitable meeting place will be arranged.  This will usually be the project office.  Chairs will be available for all attending. A visual aid (TV, projector) will be available to display the Near Term Schedule during the meeting.
   2. A person with authority and knowledge of the work will be present for each trade subcontractor.
   3. The Superintendent, an internal scheduler, or a representative of the scheduling consultant will lead the meeting.
   4. Printouts of the Near Term Schedule will be available to all attending and to the Owner.
4. The Near Term Schedule will be reviewed. The person leading the meeting will address each item with the following three questions:
   1. Has the activity been completed as scheduled at the previous meeting?
   2. If not completed, when will it be completed?
   3. If not completed, why it was not completed?
5. If the work has been completed, the activity will be shaded in a color to indicate completion.
6. If a new date is set for completion of an activity not completed, actual dates vs. original dates will be recorded in order to create variance reports as needed.
7. Adverse weather conditions must be consciously tracked as noted in[ Policy OS-210 Overall Project Schedule (OPS).](../b.-project-startup/os-210-overall-project-schedule-ops.md)
8. Float must be controlled and managed as per [Policy OS-210 Overall Project Schedule (OPS)](../b.-project-startup/os-210-overall-project-schedule-ops.md).
9. The person conducting the meeting will review the Project Manager's Material Status Log prior to the meeting. Detailed information regarding submittals, fabrication, confirmation, and the delivery of “Critical Delivery Items” (reference [Policy](../b.-project-startup/os-130-material-status-log.md) OS-130) will be included as bar chart activities on the Near Term Schedule.
10. The Action Item List created by the internal scheduler or scheduling consultant (reference example [OM-310.2](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/operations/EdaHcMC7YLBCnTTbZ6Te24wBRzkZ_tqnfVlZt1euh58m4w?e=dDDR2N)) will be used to track job progress items.  This action list will be reviewed at each Near Term meeting and will be updated to reflect the current status of the items that could affect the progress of the project.
11. When the update is complete, the Near Term Schedule will be updated and distributed to all appropriate team members, preferably immediately after the meeting for use the following day. As the Near Term Schedule is updated the overall schedule will in turn be updated as a function of the Near Term revisions.  The links and precedence should not be manipulated unless the logic has changed. This will result in the most accurate depiction of the effects of Near Term changes on the overall completion date. The updated schedule will be used by management to assess the effects of Near Term updates on the project completion date. While the overall schedule will be updated as a function of the Near Term revisions, it is the intent of this policy that only the updated Near Term Schedule is to be distributed to subcontractors.
12. A Progress Report (reference examples [OM-310.3A Progress Report P6 Example](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/operations/Ed3-P-v4EBNLgQB93E0O-oIBwLMnC6gU2S1GFeq_x7xXmw?e=ssmV8y) and [OM-310.3B Progress Report Visio Example](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/operations/EewDtc3agJ1GvZ7E9TBXyNUBR-gDA0WZi8iUUklBoPjPNw?e=0nKBbG)) will be prepared including the updated Near Term Schedule, project status, Trend Chart, Action Item List, and a roster of those attending the meeting. A Material Status Log will also be reviewed, updated and provided separately as per [Policy OS-130](../b.-project-startup/os-130-material-status-log.md).
13. The Near Term update meeting will be conducted in an open, cooperative, collaborative manner. All participants will be encouraged toward a common goal: the smooth, economic, timely completion of the project.&#x20;
14. Prior to the Near Term Schedule meeting the internal scheduler or scheduling consultant shall have first-hand knowledge of the status of the project.
