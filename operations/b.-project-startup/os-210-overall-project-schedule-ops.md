## Discussion

Planning is the orderly arrangement of the activities and components in a construction project. It is the responsibility of the Superintendent and Project Manager, and is also one of the key elements in judging their performance.

To carry-out this responsibility, a procedure has been established that requires a collaborative approach utilizing input from subcontractors and other project stakeholders. An internal scheduler or scheduling consultant will be engaged to assist in scheduling, utilizing Primavera P6 scheduling software, with an option to utilize [TimeTable](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M4PCYVMKvZlSvj9R8kj/s/-M1zPwq6IS8T_i54E-1P/) in addition to and in conjunction with Primavera P6. (If an internal scheduler or scheduling consultant is not used, or if an alternate software is preferred, the Superintendent will obtain the Operations Manager’s and Project Director’s (if applicable) approval. The absence of an internal scheduler or a scheduling consultant does not change the elements and practices of this policy.)

In addition to reviewing this policy, the Project Manager will review the Owner Contract and project specifications to ensure that any project specific scheduling requirements are incorporated into our scheduling process. If any scheduling requirements within the project specifications conflict with the Owner Contract, then our cost proposal to the Owner will be qualified accordingly.

The responsibility for establishing the schedule, and planning and executing the work, remains with the Superintendent.

Refer to OP-050.1 Planning and Scheduling Flow Chart for a visual representation of the flow of the planning and scheduling process.

## Policy

### 1. Sequencing Plan

Prior to starting construction, a plan of logical sequencing of the work will be developed. The schedule that was submitted as a part of our selection process, subject to any subsequent revisions, will be the initial basis of our plan. The Owner's facility operational considerations will be determined and integrated into this plan. The building or renovation area will be divided into manageable work areas and a Flow of Work determined. A sequencing of the structural construction of the building will then be developed to accommodate the established Flow of Work. The sequencing plan will be composed of floor plan sketches designating specific work areas and a simple precedence bar chart showing the various areas placed in the sequence they are to occur.

### 2. Pre-Data Collection Schedule

The logic of the sequencing plan will form the basis for a Pre-Data Collection schedule, prior to any input from project subcontractors. This schedule will expand the detail of the sequencing plan by breaking down each work area into individual construction components and activities. The Superintendent and Project Manager will create this schedule based on their experience with previous projects, working within the confines of our agreed upon overall project duration per the Owner Contract. The Standard Percentage Completion Schedule (SPCS) (see example OS-210.1) will also be referenced to verify milestone completion dates on the Pre-Data Collection schedule are consistent with the standard schedule. This Pre-Data Collection schedule is for internal use only and shall not be submitted to subcontractors. It will be used as a reference guideline during the development of the Overall Project Schedule (OPS). Interim Near Term Schedules and Draft OPS are conventional methods utilized to facilitate the time between start of preparation to finalization of the OPS.

### 3. Development of the OPS

The OPS will be constructed in two individual sessions that involve the participation of the subcontractors. Delivery/material lead time information from the vendors will also be reviewed in these sessions. The timeframe for developing the OPS will be determined by the Project Manager, Superintendent, Project Director (if applicable) and Operations Manager, giving it a high priority as a project start up activity.

#### A. Data Collection Session

Trade contractors will be provided with the sequencing plan and an Activity/Duration/Crew Size Worksheet (Form OS-210.2) with the areas broken down per the sequencing plan, and with the activities listed as per the Pre-Data Collection schedule noted above and to the detail required to adequately define their work. This information will be provided three weeks prior to the data collection session and will be due one week prior to the meeting. Subcontractors will be required to fill in workday durations and manpower numbers for each activity in each area listed on the form. As a guide, individual activities should be resourced and detailed so that they do not exceed two weeks in duration. This form will then be reviewed with the subcontractors in a data collection meeting. Work activities and durations will be defined in this manner. The subcontractors will also be given a Material Status Log (see Policy OS-130) to collect the submittal/shop drawing information and material fabrication and delivery durations for major equipment and materials. The Project Manager will contact vendors to obtain material delivery data. The internal scheduler or scheduling consultant will assemble the activity/duration and material status log data and assist the Superintendent with documenting the logic required to develop the Post-Data Collection schedule, which will become the framework for the OPS. The logic of the sequencing plan and the Pre-Data Collection schedule will serve as the guideline for the Post-Data Collection schedule. The activities, durations and delivery dates from data collection will be assembled to comply with the Pre-Data Collection schedule. This Post-Data Collection schedule will be utilized as a baseline for the OPS Logic Review Session, but will not be sent out to subcontractors for review and comment prior to the OPS Logic Review Session.

#### B. OPS Logic Review Session

While we understand that the OPS duration must remain within the overall project duration per the Owner Contract, there are multiple approaches that may be taken to achieve our commitment to the Owner. It is imperative that all parties work together in the interest of the common goal of completing the project within the required overall duration commitment. It is the intent of this policy to utilize a collaborative approach where everyone’s ideas are considered in order to ensure that buy in is achieved from all parties. Subcontractor buy in and sign off are fundamental to our approach and are required in order to be sure that the OPS becomes a useful tool for all parties. All subcontractors will attend a live meeting OPS Logic Review Session conducted by the Superintendent. The collaborative effort generated by this in person meeting is important and is the essence of generating an effective schedule. The final baseline OPS will be created at this OPS Logic Review Session. The Post Data Collection schedule developed by the Superintendent and the internal scheduler or scheduling consultant will be utilized at this meeting, with durations and logic modified during this meeting as necessary to work within the confines of the Pre-Data Collection schedule and Owner Contract, and with the agreement of all parties. The essence of this meeting is to create a collaborative effort with all subcontractors to establish an agreement on the OPS plan. The result of the OPS Logic Review Session will be a draft OPS which will be distributed to all subcontractors, for final review and agreement. If additional OPS sessions are needed based on the review of the draft OPS, the additional meetings shall take place to work through the durations and logic to gain commitments from subcontractors. The expectation is that a face-to-face meeting will be held with the subcontractors to review and sign off on the logic shown on the final OPS, and the final OPS will then be transmitted to the subcontractors formally via the OPS Distribution Memo (Form OS-210.3). Each subcontractor will be required to commit to the final OPS. At the completion of this development process the file will be saved as the “final baseline OPS.”

1. "[Critical Delivery Items](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]” from the Material Status Log (see Policy OS-130) will be used in the development of the OPS and will be noted as milestones on the OPS. “Critical Delivery Items” is a subset of the Material Status Log utilized to track specific materials and equipment (i.e., structural steel, chillers, generators, etc.) that are long lead items and are part of the critical development of the project. All “Critical Delivery Items” milestones will be posted on the OPS, reviewed at every Near Term meeting, and tracked on the Near Term Schedule (see Policy OM-310).
2. **Standard Percentage Completion Schedule (SPCS) Review.** Upon completion of the OPS, the Superintendent shall review it against the SPCS. The SPCS shall be used as a tool and a guideline to assure various typical milestones fall within the SPCS dates. Since every scheduling situation is unique, care should be practiced when making this evaluation. Variances from the SPCS will be reviewed with the Operations Manager on the project.
3. The final baseline OPS will be used as the master plan in constructing the project. A graphical representation of the baseline OPS will be posted on the wall of the project office. At manager’s discretion, when P6 software has been used, Time Table may be used as necessary to improve the format of the graphical representation of the OPS. Every two weeks during the Near Term meetings the status of completed activities shall be noted on this schedule. Adjustments to the OPS made during the course of the project will be noted on the OPS in handwritten form. The final baseline OPS will not change unless there is a significant change in scope, time, or logic, or unless there is a contractual requirement for a recovery schedule. Any necessary revisions to the OPS will be subject to the approval of the Operations Manager and will be performed in accordance with this policy. The OPS will be the baseline for the Near Term Schedules which will be developed in more detail during the Near Term meetings.
4. The final baseline OPS will be transmitted to the Owner for record. As a best practice, and at the discretion of the Operations Manager, the Project Manager and Superintendent will review weather, phasing, OFE, regulatory requirements, and other scheduling qualifications and considerations with the Owner at this time.

### 4. Key OPS Elements

#### A. Weather

Most projects can be exposed to adverse weather conditions that can impact the OPS. Adverse weather conditions must be consciously tracked by the Superintendent and reviewed Monthly with the Owner in the OAC meeting. Based on the Owner Contract and at the discretion of the Operations Manager and Project Director (if applicable), weather can be factored into the OPS in 2 ways:

1. Weather Critical Activities will be reviewed along with historical weather data, and the expected lost days due to weather will be built into the activity durations. A record will be kept reflecting the number of expected lost days, and the activities to which they are applied.
2. A Weather Contingency activity duration will be added to the end of the OPS, based on the expected lost days due to weather per the historical weather data. Historical weather data will be based on data obtained from NOAA.gov unless an alternate source is identified in the Owner Contract or project specifications. If a baseline for adverse weather conditions that constitutes a lost day due to weather is not identified in the Owner Contract or project specifications, a discussion will take place with the Owner and Architect to agree on the baseline, and the determined baseline will be documented by an Owner Change Order. If actual lost days due to weather exceed the expected weather days based on the above criteria then, depending upon the Owner Contract, this may be the basis of an Owner Change Order.

#### B. Float

The OPS should be developed based on “Early Start” and “Early Finish” dates for each activity. The available float will be controlled and managed by the Superintendent. If the management of float is specifically referenced in the Owner Contract or the project specifications (subject to our review and agreement as outlined above,) then a written float management plan will be developed and agreed upon at the outset of the project.

#### C. Project Completion Activities

The OPS should allow adequate time for project completion activities such as: punch list, commissioning, final cleaning, State and Local Inspections, Owner furnishings, Owner move in, etc., all of which will be included as activities on the schedule.

### 5. Development of the Summary Critical Path Schedule (SCPS)

Upon completion of OPS development, the Superintendent, with input from the Project Manager and internal scheduleror scheduling consultant, will develop the SCPS (see examples OS-210.4A Summary Critical Path Schedule P6 Example and OS-210.4B Summary Critical Path Schedule Visio Example). The SCPS will be assembled by utilizing major activities from the critical path of the OPS and linking them in the approved scheduling software program. The SCPS will be produced as part of the Progress Report developed at each Near-Term meeting. An update line will be utilized for the date of the report and all activities will be updated with the percentages of completion.

The Superintendent will give special care to the logical link and sequencing of activities both by technical precedence (i.e., foundations before steel, etc.) and by resource precedence (manpower, crews, etc.). The SCPS shall not contain activities, which are not logically linked within the schedule network. Upon completion and approval of the SCPS, the links and precedence should not be manipulated unless the logic has changed. This will result in the most accurate depiction of the effects of changes/adjustments made during the Near Term meeting on the OPS, and subsequently the overall completion date.

### 6. Early Release Packages or Phased Work

The OPS process will be used as described above for each phase of a multi phased project or a project with early release packages. Subcontractor input will be used to develop an OPS for the current phase of work, and then the information from the Pre-Data Collection schedule for the remaining phase or phases of work will be used in order to show the overall project duration until such time as an OPS for the remaining phase or phases of work can be developed.

### 7. Revisions to the Baseline OPS

In the event of a significant change in scope, time, or logic, or in the case of any contractually required recovery schedule(s), the Superintendent will assemble a meeting with the project team, including other appropriate Robins & Morton team members, the internal scheduler or scheduling consultant, and any potentially impacted subcontractors, in order to review the OPS and update as necessary in draft form pending approvals. The tools and procedures described in this policy will be utilized. Material and equipment lead times should also be considered. The Superintendent will review the updated draft OPS with the Project Director (if applicable) and the Operations Manager for approval, pending Owner review and approval if necessary. If the team determines that a contract time extension is required, then Owner review and approval is required and, upon review and approval by the Operations Manager, the revised OPS (along with any extended general conditions costs, etc.) will be presented to the Owner for approval. Upon Owner approval, the draft will become the updated OPS for the project.
