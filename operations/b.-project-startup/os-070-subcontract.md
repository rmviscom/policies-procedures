# OS-070 Subcontract

**PURPOSE:** To have a written agreement and commitment in order to monitor and control our subcontractor to meet budget.

**RESPONSIBILITY:** Project Manager

**DISCUSSION:** Failure to reach an agreement on all of the details of a subcontract, prior to signing is the most frequent source of friction and poor performance. This is the heart of our business and requires the most careful attention.

A subcontract is a written statement of an agreement reached between two parties. The agreement is the primary concern and the written contract only confirms this agreement. This agreement is best reached by Management and the contracting officer for the subcontractor, meeting together, discussing and agreeing on the terms of the subcontract, and then the subcontractor signing the subcontract. At this point, there is a binding contract, the manager having acted as the agent of the contractor. Signing by the contractor’s officer is a written confirmation of this.

**POLICY:**

      1. No work is to be done prior to the signing of the subcontract, the furnishing of proper insurance certificates and a bond if required, by the subcontractor or his representative to the Project Manager responsible for the project.
      2. Correctness and completeness of the subcontract and insurance certificate are the responsibility of the Project Manager along with the timely signature of the subcontractor.
      3. A “Meeting of the Minds” subcontract signing meeting will be held with all subcontractors that are required to be bonded or with contracts exceeding $100,000. The “Meeting of the Minds” will be held at the jobsite or the appropriate division office with the following people in attendance:

Subcontractor

* Executive Manager (contracting agent)
* Project Superintendent
* Project Manger

Robins and Morton

* Operations Manager \*\*
* Superintendent
* Project Manager

\*\* - Operations Manager shall attend at a minimum the “Meeting of the Minds” for the site, structural, exterior skin, major interior finishes, mechanical, and electrical subcontractors.

The intent of the “Meeting of the Minds” is to confirm as a group the agreement reached with the subcontractor, build a relationship with the subcontractor’s key personnel, and review project specific requirements. The attached [agenda](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/operations/PolicyAndProcedures/IV.%20FORMS/B.%20PROJECT%20START-UP/Subcontract%20Signing%20Agenda.docx) will be used as a guideline for the meeting. The project manager will take detailed meeting minutes and distribute to all attendees following the meeting.

There are times and conditions when, due the minor nature of the subcontract, travel expense is not warranted in arranging this meeting. In these cases, the project manager will seek approval from the operations manager to mail the documents for signing. This will be covered by a memo – see [Policy OS-058](https://robinsmorton.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/operations/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4D531D4F-ED53-4308-A81C-93E3E99D163B%7D\&file=OS%20058%20Preparation%20of%20Subcontract.docx\&action=default\&mobileredirect=true) for instructions.

When subcontracts are mailed for signature, special attention will be paid (1) to ensuring that an agreement has been reached and, (2) to ensure that the documents are returned unchanged.
