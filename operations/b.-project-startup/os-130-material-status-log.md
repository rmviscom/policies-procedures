# OS-130 Material Status Log

## Discussion

The timely delivery of materials to the jobsite is paramount to the success of a project. It is the responsibility of the Project Manager to track and coordinate the delivery of materials. It is also a key element in judging the Project Manager’s performance.

To carry-out this responsibility effectively, this procedure has been developed to track materials from the submittal/shop drawing phase, through the actual delivery of the materials on the project site. While all materials required by the specifications for the construction of a project are to be tracked using this policy, special attention shall be taken for “Critical Delivery Items” that are custom fabricated, not readily available, or otherwise cannot be procured on short notice are long lead items. A short list of items included in this “Critical Delivery Item” group is:

* Structural Steel
* Misc. Steel, Stairs, Railings
* Aluminum Curtainwall, Storefront Assemblies
* HVAC Equipment (AHUs, Cooling Towers, Boilers, Chillers, Fans, Unit Heaters, Pumps, Etc.)
* Electrical Switchgear, Panelboards
* Generators, Automatic Transfer Switches
* Fire, Fire/Smoke, and other Actuated Dampers
* Fire Pump and Associated Controls
* Dry Fire-Suppression System(s) and Associated Controls
* Lockers, Toilet Partitions, Louvers, and other custom-fabricated specialties
* Lighting Fixtures, Plumbing Fixtures
* Doors and Hardware
* Casework/Cabinets/Millwork
* Elevators
* Expansion Joint Assemblies

## Policy

1. The tracking of materials required for a project is handled in three phases: Submittals, Confirmation of Fabrication, and Delivery.
2. The Project Management Software System “Submittals/Material” module, along with the Material Status Log (form OS-110 Prolog), will be used to track the material status on a project.
3. Information required on the log is generally self-explanatory, as indicated by the various headings on the log, however the following additional information is provided for preparing the form:
   1. Register Number – Item number of material
   2. Rev. Number – Number of times submittal has been revised and re-submitted for review.
   3. Description – Description of material.
   4. Responsible Company – Name of Subcontractor or Vendor
      1. Submittal Data –

· Due From Sub – Submittal Schedule on P.O.

· Received From Sub – Submittal Received

· Sent to Architect – Submittal Review and Forwarded to Architect, Engineer, (and Owner if applicable).

· Received from Architect – Submittal Returned Approved from Architect, Engineer, (and Owner if applicable).

· Returned to Sub – Submittal Approved and Returned to Subcontractor/Vendor.

F. Delivery –

o Required for OPS – Date Delivery Require to Meet Overall Project Schedule.

o Sub/Vendor Confirmed Del. – Delivery Date Confirmed by Subcontractor/Vendor

o Material Released for Fab. – Date Subcontractor/Vendor released for fabrication.

o Actual Delivery – Date Received on Job

G. Action –

· Current status of submittal.

H. Notes –

· Any remark pertaining to material status.

4\. The information on this log will be completed within four (4) weeks after budget approval. This log will be continuously updated and distributed bi-weekly.

5\. The preliminary Material Status Log will be used the development of the Overall Project Schedule (see policy OS-210).

6\. A subset of materials that is considered “Critical Delivery Items” will be classified within the Project Management Software System as “Critical Delivery Items”. The delivery of “Critical Delivery Items” will be shown as milestones on the Overall Project Schedule (see policy OS-210). Detailed information regarding submittals, fabrication, delivery confirmation, and delivery will be included as activities on the Near Term Schedule (see policy OM-310).

7\. At a minimum, an entry will be made for each item (materials and equipment) required for construction that generates a submittal and/or shop drawings.

· Since certain pieces of submittals can be approved and rejected independently, it is important that separate line items be made for separate submittals relating to the same item(s). For example, a Product Data Submittal should be a separate line item than a Shop Drawing Submittal for an Expansion Joint Assembly.

· Since deliveries can be split up to better facilitate the construction/installation, it is imperative that separate line items will be created/maintained for multiple material deliveries relating to the same item(s). For example, Wood Doors for 1st Floor Area A should be tracked as a separate line item, since they deliver two months after doors for 1st Floor Area B.

8\. It is imperative that Submittal Due Dates and Delivery Dates be established and confirmed with the person who can control these submittal, approval, and delivery dates. This must be the Fabricator/Manufacturer, via the Subcontractor or Vendor.

· Written confirmation of these dates from Fabricator/Manufacturer shall be documented using Material Delivery Report (form OS-130).

· A Material Delivery Report shall be completed for each item in the “Critical Delivery Item” group, or additional items as determined by the Project Manager.

· Material Delivery Report forms shall be reviewed by the Project Manager and the Superintendent.

· The Material Delivery Report will include the following:

a. Confirmed Delivery Dates

b. Manufacturer Confirmation Numbers

c. Fabrication Start Date

d. Fabrication Time

e. Delivery Method

f. Delivery Time

g. Delivery Destination

9\. Shop drawing and approval submittal dates will be a part of the purchase order agreement or subcontractor.

10\. Shop drawing and submittal approval dates will be arranged with the Architect/Engineer/Owner and confirmed by memo.

11\. It shall be the responsibility of the Project Manager to confirm with the Subcontractor/Vendor that production/fabrication has commenced as scheduled for “Critical Delivery Items”.

12\. It shall be the responsibility of the Project Manager to confirm with the Subcontractor/Vendor that “Critical Delivery Items” have shipped as scheduled.

13\. Upon delivery on-site, the Project Manager shall take the necessary steps to insure that the correct material or equipment has been delivered. At this point, the tracking process can be closed, by entering the “Actual Delivery” date on the Material Status Log.

14\. See attached Submittals Process Diagram for flow of work and Material Status Log data points.
