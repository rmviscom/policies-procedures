{% endhint %}



The Preconstruction Manager/Estimator will request an estimate number (with the agreement of the OM responsible for the project) via HUB.&#x20;

The Preconstruction Administrative Assistant will set up an estimating project folder.&#x20;

All costs during the estimating phase of the project will be charged to the estimate number.

Costs incurred during the preconstruction phase of the project will be charged to the estimate number.  The following phase codes are established to differentiate costs charged to an estimate number:

### 100 Phase Code

* RFP/RFQ, Conceptual, and Schematic Phase Preconstruction Services
* RFP/RFQ, Conceptual, and Schematic Phase Scheduling

### 200 Phase Code

* Design Development Phase Preconstruction Services
* DD Phase Scheduling

### 300 Phase Code

* Construction Document Phase Preconstruction Services
* Early Release Packages
* Early Equipment Purchasing
* CD Phase Scheduling

### 400 Phase Code

This phase code is intended for job cost related items during the Preconstruction Phase and should be transferred to job cost after establishing a project job number. Transferring or recoding of this cost will be the responsibility of the Project Manager.  Some examples of 400 Phase Code costs are:

* Operations Personnel assisting with Preconstruction Services or during project mobilization
* Building Permit fee
* Overall Project Schedule development
* VDC Personnel assisting with BIM coordination
