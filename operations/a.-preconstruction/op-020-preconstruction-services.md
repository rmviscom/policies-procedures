> Preconstruction services include any and all activities provided prior to the actual construction of a project. Preconstruction services include, but are not limited to, planning, estimating, cost management, subcontractor development, strategy, and effective communication with the team. This is the time to set the project up for success by controlling the design, identifying and managing risks, maximizing profit, and developing strong relationships with our client representatives. The Operations Manager should work closely with the client and lead the overall preconstruction effort to ensure the established goals are met. (Refer to OP-020.1 Preconstruction Activities Matrix for a guide to preconstruction activities at various design stages.)

To ensure overall project profitability and success by providing effective leadership during preconstruction and by performing the following activities (minimum).

1. The Operations Manager shall conduct a preconstruction kick-off meeting with the R\&M team to establish strategies, work assignments, and reinforce client expectations (refer to [op-030-preconstruction-services-kickoff-meeting-intracompany.md](op-030-preconstruction-services-kickoff-meeting-intracompany.md "mention")). The R\&M team should include the Operations Manager, Project Director, Estimators, Superintendent, and Project Manager.
2. Develop an estimate appropriately prepared, based on the level of detail and progress of design, along with a strategic risk reward contingency management plan (refer to Policies OP-180 Preliminary Estimate and OP-190 Final Job Cost Estimate).
3. Prepare an overall preconstruction schedule including design activities (refer to Policy OP-050 Preconstruction Phase Scheduling).
4. Prepare a preconstruction services staffing plan with responsibilities for each individual.
5. Actively pursue and evaluate opportunities for self-performed work (refer to Self-Perform Work (SPW) Protocol). Reference Protocols on HUB.
6. Prepare a site logistics and utilization plan (refer to Policy OP-110 Proposed Site Logistics and Utilization Plan).
7. Establish, along with the client and design team, the dates and agenda for preconstruction team meetings.
8. Develop a specific overall team strategy to ensure project success.
9. Evaluate and pursue opportunities for prefabrication and modular construction.
10. Lead the preconstruction process to ensure adequate design information at each stage of design to allow for the most comprehensive and accurate estimates possible. Refer to the Checklists for Schematic Design (Form OP-020.2), Design Development (Form OP-020.3), and Final Design (Form OP-020.4) as a guide to ensure the required information is included at the various stages of design.
11. Identify and actively solicit the appropriate subcontractors and vendors to ensure competitive pricing from the most qualified bidders. It is important to recognize there are appropriate subcontractors and vendors for different types of work as well as the need to be appropriate for the geographic region of the project.
12. Ensure subcontractors and vendors are appropriate for the specific type of project delivery (IPD, cost plus, hard dollar, etc.).
13. Prior to soliciting and using early pricing feedback from subcontractors, the preconstruction leader or a person designated by the Operations Manager, will ensure the subcontractor meets Policy OP-170 Subcontractor Qualification. Obtaining pricing from non-qualified subcontractors is not effective in establishing pricing to manage risk.
14. The Operations Manager, Project Director, Senior Project Manager, and the Director of Contract Administration will evaluate the proposed contract. The Operations Manager will ensure the estimate is developed in accordance with the contract terms to maximize profits and mitigate the risk associated with the contract terms as much as possible.
